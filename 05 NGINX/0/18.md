To configure NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer in Docker, follow these summarized steps:

1. Use the official NGINX Docker image as a base:

```
docker run -d --name nginx-proxy -p 80:80 nginx:latest
```

2. Create a custom NGINX config file (e.g., `default.conf`) with reverse proxy and load balancing settings. For load
   balancing among multiple backend containers, use the `upstream` directive:

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1:8080;
    server backend2:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Here, `backend1` and `backend2` are Docker service or container names reachable in a Docker network.

3. Mount the custom config into the NGINX container:

```
docker run -d --name nginx-proxy -p 80:80 \
  -v /path/to/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro \
  --network your_docker_network nginx:latest
```

4. Make sure backend containers (`backend1` and `backend2`) are on the same Docker network `your_docker_network`.

5. Use `docker-compose` for multi-container setup, defining NGINX service with config mounted and backends.

This config enables NGINX running in a Docker container to act as both a reverse proxy forwarding requests to backend
containers and a load balancer distributing traffic across multiple backend instances.

Additional tuning like health checks, session persistence, HTTPS, and caching is possible but this is the core setup.

This approach is widely used for containerized microservices and web apps to route and balance requests efficiently inside
Docker environments.[1][2][3]
