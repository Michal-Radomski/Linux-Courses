NGINX is open-source web server software known for its high performance, stability, and low resource usage. Originally
designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, NGINX uses an event-driven, asynchronous, and
non-blocking architecture. This makes it exceptionally suited for serving static content, acting as a reverse proxy, load
balancer, cache, and providing HTTPS server capabilities.

The core architecture separates the roles between a master process, which manages configurations and worker processes, and
several worker processes that handle incoming requests efficiently in a non-blocking manner. NGINX can also proxy email
protocols such as IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.

There are two main versions: NGINX Open Source, widely used for its reliability and versatility, and NGINX Plus, a commercial
version that includes extra features like advanced load balancing and health checks.

NGINX powers many of the Internet's busiest sites and is popular for both personal and enterprise-level web infrastructure
due to its speed, efficiency, and flexibility.[4][6][8][10]
