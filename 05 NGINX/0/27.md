To enable HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 on Apache2 and NGINX web servers, here is a concise guide:

### Apache2

**Enable HTTP/2:**

1. Ensure Apache version 2.4.17 or higher is installed.
2. Enable HTTPS on the server (HTTP/2 usually requires TLS).
3. Disable the incompatible `mpm_prefork` module and enable `mpm_event`:
   ```
   sudo a2dismod mpm_prefork
   sudo a2enmod mpm_event
   ```
4. Enable SSL and HTTP/2 modules:
   ```
   sudo a2enmod ssl
   sudo a2enmod http2
   ```
5. Edit your Apache configuration (e.g., `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or the virtual host file) to add the following line to
   enable HTTP/2:
   ```
   Protocols h2 h2c http/1.1
   ```
6. Restart Apache:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

**Enable HTTP/3:**

- Apache HTTP Server itself has very limited support for HTTP/3 and usually requires patches or third-party modules (like
  mod_http3 from quiche). Most often, HTTP/3 support is provided via a reverse proxy or CDN in front of Apache rather than
  directly configured in Apache.

### NGINX

**Enable HTTP/2:**

1. Use NGINX version 1.9.5 or newer.
2. Configure HTTPS with TLS for your site.
3. Add `http2` parameter to the `listen` directive in the server block:
   ```
   listen 443 ssl http2;
   ```
4. Reload/restart NGINX.

**Enable HTTP/3:**

1. Use a recent NGINX build with HTTP/3 support, generally from the mainline version or a custom build.
2. Configure QUIC and HTTP/3 by adding:
   ```
   listen 443 ssl http2;
   listen 443 quic reuseport;
   ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
   ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
   ```
3. Enable the `alt-svc` header to advertise HTTP/3 support.
4. Ensure TLS 1.3 is enabled as HTTP/3 requires it.
5. Restart NGINX.

Because HTTP/3 adoption is newer, enabling it on Apache often involves additional modules or using a proxy like NGINX or a
CDN. NGINX has better out-of-the-box HTTP/3 support with recent versions.

In summary:

- HTTP/2 on Apache requires enabling `http2` module, disabling `mpm_prefork` in favor of `mpm_event`, and enabling HTTPS.
- HTTP/3 on Apache needs third-party modules or proxies for practical use.
- HTTP/2 on NGINX requires `http2` in the listen directive.
- HTTP/3 on NGINX requires enabling QUIC and HTTP/3 in listen directives with TLS 1.3 support.

These instructions assume you have valid SSL/TLS certificates configured for HTTPS. Details may vary by distribution and
versions.[1][2][3]
