The `X-Real-IP` directive in NGINX is a custom HTTP header typically set by NGINX when acting as a reverse proxy. It carries
the original client’s IP address (the "real IP") to the backend server.

When NGINX proxies a request to an upstream server, the backend normally sees the IP address of the proxy (NGINX) itself as
the client IP. To inform the backend about the actual client IP, NGINX sets the `X-Real-IP` header with the client’s IP
address using:

```
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
```

Here `$remote_addr` is the NGINX variable representing the IP address of the client connecting to NGINX.

This header is often used alongside `X-Forwarded-For`, but differs in that `X-Real-IP` typically contains exactly one IP (the
immediate client IP NGINX saw), while `X-Forwarded-For` can contain a list of IPs if multiple proxies are involved.

Backend servers can read the `X-Real-IP` header to log or apply logic based on the true client IP instead of the proxy’s IP.

In summary:

- `X-Real-IP` provides the originating client IP to backend servers behind a proxy.
- It is set by NGINX to the value of the connecting client's IP (`$remote_addr`).
- It helps backends identify the actual client for logging, security, or routing decisions.

This is important in reverse proxy setups for accurate client IP reporting and processing.[1][5][7]
