In Apache2 (version 2.4 and later), to allow or deny access for specific IPs, use the `Require` directive inside
`<Directory>`, `<Location>`, or `<VirtualHost>` blocks. For example:

- To deny a specific IP:
  ```apache
  <Directory /var/www/html>
    Require all granted
    Require not ip 192.168.1.100
  </Directory>
  ```
- To allow only specific IP(s):
  ```apache
  <Directory /var/www/html>
    Require ip 192.168.1.0/24
  </Directory>
  ```
- To deny everyone except certain IP(s):
  ```apache
  <Directory /var/www/html>
    Require all denied
    Require ip 192.168.1.10
  </Directory>
  ```

In NGINX, use `allow` and `deny` directives within a `location` or `server` block:

- To allow a specific IP and deny all others:
  ```nginx
  location / {
    allow 192.168.1.100;
    deny all;
  }
  ```
- To deny a specific IP but allow others:
  ```nginx
  location / {
    deny 192.168.1.100;
    allow all;
  }
  ```

NGINX processes these directives in order, so order matters. First matching rule applies.

This setup lets you control client access precisely based on IP addresses in both Apache2 and NGINX web servers.[1][3][4]
