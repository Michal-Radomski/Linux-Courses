A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and acts as an intermediary between clients (such as web
browsers) and those servers. When a user's request reaches the reverse proxy, it forwards the request to the appropriate
backend web server, then receives the server's response and sends it back to the user. This setup hides the identity and
details of the backend servers, enhancing security by protecting them from direct exposure to the internet.

Reverse proxies provide multiple benefits, including improved security by shielding origin servers from attacks, load
balancing to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple servers, and performance optimization through caching and content
management. They also enhance reliability and can enforce web application security policies. Unlike a forward proxy that
serves clients usually within a private network requesting internet resources, a reverse proxy serves external clients
accessing internal servers. Open source software like Nginx and HAProxy commonly implement reverse proxy functions. Overall,
a reverse proxy acts as a "middleman" that manages and controls client-server communications to improve security,
scalability, and performance of web applications.[1][2][3][4][5]
