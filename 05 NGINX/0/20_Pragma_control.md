The Pragma header is an HTTP/1.0 general header primarily used to control caching behavior. Its most common and widely
recognized directive is:

- **Pragma: no-cache**

This directive tells browsers and intermediate caches that they should not use a cached version of the resource, but instead
request a fresh copy from the server. Essentially, it instructs caches to revalidate the resource before using it.

Originally, the Pragma header was meant only for use in client requests and was designed for backward compatibility with
HTTP/1.0 caches. However, it is less reliable than the newer HTTP/1.1 Cache-Control header, which provides more comprehensive
caching directives and can be used in both requests and responses.

In modern use, Pragma: no-cache is often sent by browsers during a reload to ensure content freshness, but it is considered
legacy and primarily maintained for compatibility with older clients and proxies.

In summary, "Pragma control" refers to using the Pragma HTTP header, specifically Pragma: no-cache, to control caching
behavior in HTTP/1.0 contexts.[1][2][3][4]
