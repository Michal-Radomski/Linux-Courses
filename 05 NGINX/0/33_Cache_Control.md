Cache control in Apache2 and NGINX refers to setting HTTP headers that dictate how content is cached by browsers and proxy
servers, influencing performance and resource freshness.

### Cache Control in Apache2

In Apache2, cache control is commonly set using the `Header` directive provided by the `mod_headers` module. You typically
configure it in the virtual host file or `.htaccess`. For example, to cache certain file types for 1 hour and make them
publicly cacheable, you can add:

```
<filesMatch "\.(ico|pdf|flv|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|js|css|swf)$">
  Header set Cache-Control "max-age=3600, public"
</filesMatch>
```

This sets the `Cache-Control` header with a max-age of 3600 seconds and the public directive indicating the response can be
cached by any cache (browser, proxy). This configuration can be placed in site config or `.htaccess` and should be included
for SSL sites in the SSL vhost config.[5]

### Cache Control in NGINX

In NGINX, cache control can be set with the `add_header` directive inside `location` blocks or server context. For example:

```
location ~* \.(ico|pdf|flv|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|js|css|swf)$ {
  expires 1h;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
}
```

The `expires` directive sets the `Expires` header and can implicitly set cache times. The `Cache-Control` header can specify
caching behavior such as `public` (cacheable by all) and `no-transform` (prevents intermediate proxies from altering the
resource). NGINX also respects cache-control headers from upstream by default, caching content based on `Expires` or
`Cache-Control:max-age` headers. You can override certain behaviors with directives like `proxy_ignore_headers` to ignore
cache headers or `proxy_cache_valid` to specify caching durations explicitly.[1][5]

### Summary

| Feature            | Apache2                          | NGINX                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Set Cache-Control  | `Header set Cache-Control`       | `add_header Cache-Control`                  |
| Typical usage      | In `<filesMatch>` or `.htaccess` | In `location` block                         |
| Cache directives   | max-age, public, private         | max-age, public, private, no-transform      |
| Additional control | via `mod_headers`                | `expires` directive for expiration times    |
| Overrides          | Less common                      | `proxy_ignore_headers`, `proxy_cache_valid` |

This approach enhances site speed by controlling how and how long resources are cached on client and intermediary
caches.[1][5]

The Cache-Control header in HTTP allows you to specify caching directives that control how, where, and for how long content
is cached by browsers and intermediate caches like proxies and CDNs. Here are key values (directives) and their meanings:

### Common Cache-Control Values

- **max-age=[seconds]**: Specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) a resource is considered fresh. For example,
  `max-age=3600` means the resource can be cached for one hour.

- **s-maxage=[seconds]**: Similar to max-age but specifically for shared caches (e.g., proxies and CDNs), overriding max-age.

- **public**: Indicates the response can be cached by any cache, even if it is normally non-cacheable or only cacheable by
  the browser.

- **private**: Indicates the response is intended for a single user and should not be stored by shared caches but can be
  cached by the browser.

- **no-cache**: Forces caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy,
  ensuring freshness.

- **no-store**: Instructs caches not to store any part of the request or response, effectively disabling caching.

- **no-transform**: Prevents proxies and other intermediaries from modifying the response content.

- **must-revalidate**: Tells caches that they must obey freshness information and revalidate expired responses before reuse.

- **proxy-revalidate**: Like must-revalidate but applies only to shared caches.

- **immutable**: Indicates that the resource will not change over time, so the cache doesnâ€™t need to revalidate it.

- **stale-while-revalidate=[seconds]**: Allows caches to serve stale content while asynchronously revalidating in the
  background.

- **stale-if-error=[seconds]**: Permits serving stale content if an error occurs during validation or fetching.

### Request-only Directives

- **max-stale**: Indicates the client accepts a stale response no older than the specified time.

- **min-fresh**: Indicates the client wants a response that will be fresh for at least the specified time.

- **only-if-cached**: The client wants a cached response only and no network request should be made.

These directives can be combined and are case-insensitive. For example:

```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public, must-revalidate
```

means the resource is cacheable for an hour by any cache but must be revalidated once stale.

This comprehensive set of values allows precise control over caching strategies to optimize performance and freshness across
browsers and intermediary caches.[1][2][3][5][6][9][10]
