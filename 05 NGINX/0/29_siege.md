The siege package is a popular HTTP load testing and benchmarking tool used to simulate multiple users accessing a web
server, to test its performance and stability under stress on Ubuntu systems.

### What is Siege?

Siege helps simulate a high volume of HTTP requests to a web server, allowing you to measure how well the server handles
concurrent connections, response times, throughput, and error rates. It's frequently used to expose potential bottlenecks or
vulnerabilities under load.

### How to Install Siege on Ubuntu

You can install Siege easily via Ubuntuâ€™s default package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install siege
```

Alternatively, for the latest features, you can download and compile the source code manually from the Siege website.

### Basic Usage of Siege

- To simulate 10 concurrent users making requests to a URL:

```bash
siege -c 10 http://example.com
```

- To run the test for a specific duration (e.g., 30 seconds):

```bash
siege -c 10 -d 30s http://example.com
```

- To add custom headers or cookies, useful for authentication or specialized testing:

```bash
siege -c 10 --header "User-Agent: MyAgent" --cookie "session=abc123" http://example.com
```

- To see detailed response codes during testing, use verbose mode:

```bash
siege -v -c 10 http://example.com
```

- To save the output to a file:

```bash
siege -c 10 http://example.com > output.txt
```

- To run the test in the background, allowing it to continue after logout:

```bash
nohup siege -c 10 http://example.com &
```

### Configuration

Siege includes a configuration file (`/etc/siege/siegerc`) where you can set defaults like number of concurrent users, delay
between requests, test duration, and output format.

Siege is a flexible tool to benchmark and stress test web servers on Ubuntu, helping to evaluate their capacity and
robustness.[1][2]
