Microcache in NGINX is a caching strategy where content is cached for a very short duration, typically from 1 second to a few
minutes. This technique is designed to handle rapid bursts of traffic efficiently by serving cached responses to many users
within that short window, rather than hitting the backend server repeatedly. It is particularly useful for dynamic content
that changes frequently but can tolerate slight delays (seconds) in freshness.

Key points about microcaching in NGINX:

- Microcaching caches responses for very short times (e.g., 1 second).
- It reduces load on backend servers during traffic spikes by serving cached content.
- NGINX directives like `proxy_cache_valid 200 1s;` set the cache duration.
- Additional directives like `proxy_cache_lock` and `proxy_cache_use_stale` improve efficiency by queuing requests while
  backend responses update and serving stale content temporarily.
- Microcaching is not suitable for highly dynamic pages that need real-time data but works well for pages that can tolerate
  very brief staleness.
- It improves performance, reduces backend CPU and database load, and can handle bot traffic bursts effectively.

In summary, microcache in NGINX is a very short-term cache that boosts performance and scalability by temporarily storing
generated page responses and serving them repeatedly within a brief time window.[1][2][3][4][6]
