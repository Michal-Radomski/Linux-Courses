NGINX logs are typically stored in the /var/log/nginx/ directory on most Unix-like operating systems. The two primary log
files are:

- access.log: This file records all requests processed by the NGINX server.
- error.log: This file contains information about errors encountered by NGINX during request processing.

By default, on common Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and RHEL, the paths are:

- /var/log/nginx/access.log
- /var/log/nginx/error.log

On FreeBSD, log files are usually named /var/log/nginx-access.log and /var/log/nginx-error.log. On Windows, logs are often
found under the nginx/logs/ directory.

These default locations can be customized in the NGINX configuration files using the access_log and error_log directives
typically found in the main nginx.conf or within specific server or location blocks. Logging can be directed to different
files or even disabled per location if needed.

If you want to find the exact log locations for a particular NGINX installation, you can search configuration files with
commands like:

```
grep -r "access_log\|error_log" /etc/nginx/
```

or check the main config file:

```
cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep "log"
```

This helps especially if logs are organized per project or virtual host, with different log files for different sites or
locations.

In summary, NGINX logs are by default located in /var/log/nginx/ on most systems, with access.log and error.log as the main
files, but their exact paths and configurations may vary according to your setup.[1][2][4]
