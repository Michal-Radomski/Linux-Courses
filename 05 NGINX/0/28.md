To protect Apache and NGINX servers against DOS and DDoS attacks, a combination of configuration tweaks, modules, and
software firewalls form an effective multilayered defense:

### Apache DOS Protection

- Use modules like mod_evasive (blocks IPs exceeding request thresholds) and mod_security (acts as a Web Application Firewall
  to block suspicious traffic and limit data posted) to monitor and mitigate attacks.
- Configure software firewalls such as ConfigServer Security & Firewall (CSF) or iptables to limit connections and enable SYN
  flood protection.
- Adjust Apache settings to implement thresholds on request rates per IP, blocking excessive requests.
- Additional strategies include using tools like DDoS Deflate or Fail2ban to automatically block malicious IP addresses and
  fine-tuning kernel parameters to optimize the server response.
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic and increase resilience against attack spikes.

### NGINX DOS Protection

- Leverage NGINX's event-driven architecture that efficiently handles large volumes of connections without overloading server
  resources.
- Implement rate limiting using directives like `limit_req_zone` and `limit_req` to restrict the number of requests per
  client IP within a time window, preventing excessive requests (e.g., allowing login attempts only every 2 seconds).
- Configure NGINX as a reverse proxy with rate limiting and timeout parameters to absorb attack traffic before it reaches
  backend servers.
- Additional commercial version NGINX Plus offers more advanced DDoS mitigation features.

### Common Best Practices

- Deploy a multi-layered security approach combining web server modules, firewall rules, and network-level protections.
- Tune configurations to match your environment and traffic patterns to avoid blocking legitimate users.
- Monitor traffic logs continuously to detect and respond swiftly to attack patterns.
- Use external DDoS protection services or cloud-based scrubbing if under sustained large-scale attacks.

By combining these techniques, Apache and NGINX servers can maintain performance and availability while effectively
mitigating DOS and DDoS threats.[1][2][4][9][10]
