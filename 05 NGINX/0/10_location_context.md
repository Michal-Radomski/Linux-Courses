The Location Block Context in NGINX is a configuration block contained within a server block that defines how NGINX should
process and respond to requests for specific resources based on their URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Location blocks
match parts of the request URI and determine the routing or processing behavior for those matched requests.

### Key Characteristics of Location Block Context in NGINX:

- It resides inside a server block or can be nested inside another location block.
- It matches the request URI after the domain name or IP address/port part.
- The syntax looks like this:
  ```
  location [modifier] [location_match] {
      # configuration directives
  }
  ```
- Location blocks can use prefixes for string matching or regular expressions for pattern matching.
- There are different types of location matches:
  - Exact match (`=`) for precise URI matches.
  - Prefix match (default) for matching the beginning of the request URI.
  - Case-sensitive (`~`) or case-insensitive (`~*`) regular expression matches.

### Function and Use:

- Location blocks further divide request handling within a server block.
- They enable routing requests to different backends, serving static files from specific directories, applying access
  controls, or rewriting URLs.
- NGINX selects the most specific matching location block based on the request URI.
- Location blocks can be nested to create hierarchical routing rules.

### Context Hierarchy and Scope:

- Location blocks live within server contexts.
- Server blocks match based on IP address, port, and hostname.
- Location blocks then match more specifically based on the request URI.
- Directives within a location block apply only to requests handled by that block.

In summary, the Location Block Context provides a way to control and customize how NGINX responds to requests targeted at
specified URI patterns within a server block, making it a critical mechanism for flexible routing and content delivery in
NGINX configurations.[1][2][3][4][6][9]
