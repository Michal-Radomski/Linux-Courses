Apache HTTP Server is used in Docker containers but is less commonly preferred compared to NGINX for certain containerized
environments mainly because of differences in resource usage, performance, and simplicity.

NGINX is designed as an event-driven, asynchronous architecture which makes it more lightweight and better suited to handle
high concurrency with lower memory and CPU usage. This efficiency aligns well with the container paradigm which favors
minimal, fast, and scalable services. Apache, in contrast, uses a process- or thread-based model which has higher overhead
making it heavier in resource consumption inside containers.

Additionally, NGINX is often favored as a reverse proxy and load balancer in microservices architectures commonly deployed
with Docker, while Apacheâ€™s rich module ecosystem and configurability are more useful in traditional full web server setups.

However, Apache still has official Docker images and is perfectly viable for container use when the use case requires its
specific features, such as complex configurations or legacy applications relying on Apache modules.

So, the key reasons Apache is less used than NGINX in Docker are NGINX's lightweight, performance, and design benefits that
better match containerized environments, though Apache remains available for those who need its capabilities.[1][2]
