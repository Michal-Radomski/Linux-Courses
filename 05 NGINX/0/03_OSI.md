# OSI and TCP/IP Models Explained

These two models are conceptual frameworks used to understand and design how different layers in computer networking interact
for data communication.

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI Model consists of **7 layers**, each with specific functions:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1):** Transmits raw bits over a physical medium, dealing with cables, connectors, electrical
   signals, and how bits are physically sent.
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):** Packages bits into frames, handles error detection, and controls access to the physical
   medium, ensuring error-free transmission between nodes on the same network.
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3):** Routes data packets between devices across different networks and manages logical addressing
   (like IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4):** Ensures reliable data transfer through segmentation, error detection, and flow control,
   managing end-to-end communication.
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5):** Manages sessions (connections) between devices, including establishing, maintaining, and
   terminating connections.
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6):** Translates data formats, handles encryption/decryption and compression to make data
   interpret-able by the application.
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7):** Interfaces directly with end-user software like web browsers or email clients, enabling
   network services.

## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model has **4 layers** and is the practical basis for the internet:

1. **Link Layer:** Corresponds roughly to OSI's Physical and Data Link layers, handling physical transmission and framing.
2. **Internet Layer:** Maps to the OSI Network layer, responsible for logical addressing and routing (e.g., IP).
3. **Transport Layer:** Similar to OSI Transport layer, it ensures reliable (TCP) or best-effort (UDP) data delivery.
4. **Application Layer:** Combines OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers, handling high-level protocols such as
   HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

Both models help organize networking concepts, with OSI being more detailed and theoretical, while TCP/IP is simpler and
widely used in real networks.
