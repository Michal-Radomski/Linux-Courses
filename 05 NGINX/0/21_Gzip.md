Gzip encoding on web servers refers to using the gzip compression algorithm to compress HTTP responses before sending them to
clients, significantly reducing the size of data transferred and speeding up website load times.

### How Gzip Encoding Works on Web Servers

- Clients (browsers) send an `Accept-Encoding` header indicating support for gzip compression.
- The server checks for this header and, if enabled, compresses the response body using gzip.
- The server adds the header `Content-Encoding: gzip` to the HTTP response, signaling the client to decompress the content
  before rendering.
- Compression is lossless, preserving the integrity of files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, fonts, and other text-based
  assets.

### Enabling Gzip on Apache

- Use the `mod_deflate` module.
- Add directives like:

```apache
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css application/javascript application/json application/xml application/rss+xml
</IfModule>
```

- This configuration compresses specified MIME types.
- The server automatically sends gzipped content if the client supports it.

### Enabling Gzip on NGINX

- Edit `nginx.conf` in the `http` block to include:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 6;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript application/xml text/xml application/rss+xml;
```

- This enables gzip compression for various content types with a balanced compression level.
- After configuration, restart NGINX to apply changes.

### Benefits of Gzip Encoding on Web Servers

- Reduces bandwidth usage.
- Speeds up web page load times.
- Improves user experience and search engine optimization.

### Important Notes

- Always test gzip compression using online tools or browser developer tools.
- Compress mainly text-based files since binary files (images, videos) are already compressed.
- Beware of higher compression levels increasing CPU load on the server.

In summary, gzip encoding on web servers is a widely supported and effective method to optimize web performance by
compressing HTTP responses, configured via modules like mod_deflate on Apache and gzip directives on NGINX.[1][2][3][4]

Compression levels in gzip range from 1 to 9, representing the trade-off between compression speed and the degree of
compression achieved:

- **Level 1 (fastest compression)**: Offers the quickest compression speed but the lowest reduction in file size (around
  50-60% compression). This level is beneficial for dynamic content where minimizing CPU use and latency is critical.
- **Levels 2 to 3 (fast)**: Still prioritize speed over compression ratio, achieving slightly better compression than level 1
  but still focused on quick processing.

- **Levels 4 to 6 (balanced)**: These levels strike a balance between speed and compression efficiency. Level 6 is the
  default used by many gzip implementations and achieves 65-75% compression, making it suitable for most scenarios.

- **Levels 7 to 9 (maximum compression)**: Offer the highest compression ratios (up to about 70-80%), which is ideal for
  static files that don't change frequently. This comes at the expense of significantly higher CPU usage and longer
  compression times.

Choosing a compression level depends on your priorities: use lower levels to reduce CPU load and maintain low latency, or
higher levels when saving bandwidth is more important and extra CPU time is acceptable. Typically, web servers use level 6 as
a good compromise between compression ratio and performance.

Additionally, web servers allow configuration of the compression level, for example the `gzip_comp_level` directive in NGINX
or similar options in Apache, to tune this parameter according to specific needs.

In summary, compression levels let you control the trade-off between compression speed and output size: lower levels compress
faster with less size reduction, higher levels compress smaller but take more time and CPU resources.[2][4][5][6]
