The difference between TCP, IP, UDP, and protocols like HTTPS and FTP lies primarily in their roles and functions within
network communication:

1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP (Internet Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are fundamental protocols
   involved in data transmission over networks.

   - TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data with error checking and
     acknowledgments. It is used by protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP for safe communication.
   - UDP is a connectionless protocol faster than TCP but does not guarantee data delivery, order, or error correction. It is
     used where speed is critical, like VoIP and streaming.
   - IP handles addressing and routing packets across networks but does not ensure delivery reliability.

2. HTTPS, FTP, and similar protocols operate at higher layers of the network model:
   - HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an application layer protocol that uses TCP for reliable communication. It
     adds encryption for secure web browsing.
   - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is also an application layer protocol using TCP to allow reliable file transfer between
     client and server.

In summary:

- TCP, IP, UDP form the transport and network layers managing how data is sent, routed, and delivered.
- HTTPS and FTP are application layer protocols running over TCP to provide specific services like secure web browsing and
  file transfer.[1][3][5][9]
