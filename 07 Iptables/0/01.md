Netfilter and iptables are closely related components in the Linux ecosystem for firewall and packet filtering.

Netfilter is a framework within the Linux kernel that provides the underlying packet filtering, network address translation
(NAT), and packet mangling capabilities. It consists of a set of hooks in the kernel networking stack, allowing registered
programs to inspect, modify, accept, or drop packets passing through the system at various points (such as incoming,
outgoing, or forwarded packets). Netfilter operates at a low level within the kernel to manage network traffic and enforce
security rules.

Iptables is a user-space utility program that acts as the interface to the Netfilter framework. It allows administrators to
define rules organized into tables and chains that specify what to do with network packets (e.g., accept, drop, reject, log).
Iptables rules handle filtering based on various packet attributes like source/destination IP, port, protocol, connection
state, and more. Iptables rulesets are categorized into tables (e.g., filter, nat, mangle) and chains (e.g., INPUT, OUTPUT,
FORWARD).

In essence, Netfilter is the underlying kernel infrastructure that performs the packet filtering, while iptables is the
user-level tool to configure and manage those filtering rules.

Summary:

| Aspect    | Netfilter                                     | iptables                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Level     | Kernel-level packet filtering framework       | User-space command-line utility                  |
| Function  | Provides hooks for packet processing          | Configures filtering rules for Netfilter         |
| Role      | Core packet inspection and manipulation       | Interface for defining firewall policies         |
| Operation | Works on packets in kernel's networking stack | Manages rulesets and chains that kernel enforces |

Netfilter and iptables together provide Linux systems with powerful, stateful firewalling with NAT, filtering, and advanced
packet manipulation capabilities.[1][2][3][4]
