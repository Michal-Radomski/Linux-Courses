Unicast, multicast, and broadcast refer to different methods of transmitting data packets over a network:

- Unicast is a one-to-one communication where data is sent from a single sender to a specific single receiver. It uses unique
  IP or MAC addresses to route data precisely to the intended destination, making it the most common form of data
  transmission on networks.[1][3][5]

- Multicast is a one-to-many communication where data is sent from one sender to multiple receivers who have expressed
  interest in receiving the data. It efficiently delivers the same data to multiple devices without sending separate copies
  to each receiver.[2][4][8]

- Broadcast is a one-to-all communication method where data packets are sent from one sender to all devices on the network.
  It can be limited to a local network (limited broadcast) or directed to all devices on a different subnet (direct
  broadcast), often used for distributing information like ARP requests or media content.[4][1]

In summary, unicast targets a single recipient, multicast targets multiple specific recipients, and broadcast targets all
devices in the network segment or subnet.[10][2]
