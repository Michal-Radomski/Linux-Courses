SNAT (Source NAT) and DNAT (Destination NAT) in iptables differ primarily in which part of the packet they modify and when:

- SNAT changes the source IP address (and optionally the source port) of outgoing packets. It is used so multiple devices in
  a private network can share a single public IP when accessing external networks (e.g., the internet). SNAT occurs after
  routing decisions (post-routing). It hides internal IP addresses behind the public IP.

- DNAT changes the destination IP address (and optionally the destination port) of incoming packets. Its main use is to
  redirect incoming traffic from a public IP to an internal private IP, such as forwarding requests from the internet to an
  internal web server. DNAT occurs before routing decisions (pre-routing).

In summary, SNAT handles outbound traffic by modifying the source address, while DNAT manages inbound traffic by modifying
the destination address.

Regarding NAT vs MASQUERADE:

- NAT is a broad term for Network Address Translation mechanisms like SNAT and DNAT, which translate IP addresses for routing
  purposes. SNAT is typically configured with static public IP addresses.

- MASQUERADE is a special type of SNAT used when the public IP is dynamic (such as dial-up or DHCP-assigned IPs). MASQUERADE
  automatically uses the IP of the outgoing interface, simplifying configuration in dynamic IP scenarios.

So, MASQUERADE is essentially a variant of SNAT optimized for changing or dynamic IP addresses, while NAT is the overall
concept of address translation covering both SNAT and DNAT.

These distinctions are important for configuring firewalls and routers to manage traffic correctly and securely in complex
network setups.[1][2][3][5]
