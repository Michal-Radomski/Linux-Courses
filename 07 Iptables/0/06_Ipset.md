Ipset in Linux is a utility that manages IP sets within the Linux kernel, allowing efficient storage and matching of
collections of IP addresses, port numbers, or IP and MAC address pairs. It serves as an extension to iptables for creating
firewall rules that apply to entire sets of addresses at once, improving performance by using indexed data structures for
fast lookups, even with large sets. This reduces complexity and overhead compared to traditional linear iptables rules,
enabling more manageable and scalable firewall configurations. Ipset is commonly used to block or allow multiple IPs with
minimal system resource use and better network traffic handling.[1][3][4]
