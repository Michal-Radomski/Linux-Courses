Here is an example of testing logical AND (-a) in bash using the traditional test command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number: " num

if [ "$num" -gt 10 -a "$num" -lt 20 ]; then
  echo "The number is between 11 and 19."
else
  echo "The number is not between 11 and 19."
fi
```

Explanation:

- The `-a` operator acts as logical AND to combine two conditions inside the `[ ... ]` test.
- This checks if the number entered is greater than 10 AND less than 20.
- Both conditions must be true for the if-condition to succeed.

Alternatively, Bash's modern syntax prefers `[[ ... ]]` with `&&` for logical AND:

```bash
if [[ "$num" -gt 10 && "$num" -lt 20 ]]; then
  echo "The number is between 11 and 19."
else
  echo "The number is not between 11 and 19."
fi
```

Both achieve logical AND testing in bash conditionals.[1][2][4]
