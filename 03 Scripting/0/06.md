In Linux, the most popular and commonly used exit codes are:

- 0: Success (the command or script executed successfully)
- 1: General error (catchall for general errors)
- 2: Misuse of shell builtins (such as syntax errors in shell commands)
- 126: Command invoked cannot execute (permission problems or command is not executable)
- 127: Command not found
- 128+n: Fatal error signal "n" (for example, 130 indicates script terminated by Ctrl-C with SIGINT (2 + 128))
- 130: Script terminated by Ctrl-C (SIGINT)
- 255: Exit status out of range or general failure

These codes are part of conventions widely followed in Linux shells and scripting. Exit codes 125 to 255 have special
reserved meanings by shells and should be used carefully to avoid interfering with shell operations. The standard practice is
to use 0 for success and 1 for general failure, with other values indicating specific error conditions.

Here is a short list table:

| Exit Code | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0         | Success                                  |
| 1         | General error                            |
| 2         | Misuse of shell built-ins                |
| 126       | Command invoked cannot execute           |
| 127       | Command not found                        |
| 130       | Script terminated by Ctrl-C (SIGINT)     |
| 255       | Exit status out of range or general fail |

This is based on typical Linux shell conventions and documented listings of exit codes.[1][2][6][7]
