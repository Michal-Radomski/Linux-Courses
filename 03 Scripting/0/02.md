In Bash scripting, the common convention for variable names and identifiers is to use all uppercase letters with words
separated by underscores. This style is similar to "snake case" but typically in uppercase (e.g., VARIABLE_NAME). Camel case
(e.g., variableName) and Pascal case (e.g., VariableName) are generally not used or recommended in Bash scripting
conventions.

This convention helps differentiate environment variables and script variables, and it aligns with the traditional Unix shell
scripting style. Additionally, uppercase with underscores makes variable names more readable and distinct from commands and
functions.

The case statement in Bash itself is not related to naming conventions but is a control structure used for pattern matching
based on input values.

Summary:

- Bash variables typically use uppercase with underscores (e.g., MY_VAR).
- Camel case and Pascal case are uncommon in Bash scripting.
- This style aids readability and environment variable distinction.

This aligns with common Bash scripting style guides and examples.[5][7][8]
