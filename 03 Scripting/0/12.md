The main difference between an until loop and a while loop in Bash lies in how they evaluate the loop condition:

- A while loop executes the loop body **as long as the condition is true**. It keeps running while the provided condition
  remains true and stops when it becomes false.
- An until loop executes the loop body **as long as the condition is false**. It keeps running until the condition becomes
  true, then it stops.

In summary, the until loop runs when the while loop would not, because it is based on the negation of the same condition.
Both loops can achieve the same outcome but differ in the logic expression for continuation.

Here is a quick conceptual comparison:

| Loop Type | Condition for Loop to Run | Loop Stops When Condition |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| while     | Condition is true         | Condition becomes false   |
| until     | Condition is false        | Condition becomes true    |

For example, a while loop counting up while less than 5:

```bash
while [ $count -lt 5 ]
do
  echo $count
  ((count++))
done
```

versus an until loop that counts until count hits 5:

```bash
until [ $count -ge 5 ]
do
  echo $count
  ((count++))
done
```

Both produce the same output but use opposite conditions for their termination criteria.[1][3][4][7]

The choice of using while or until usually depends on which condition is more naturally expressed in the specific scenario
for code clarity.
