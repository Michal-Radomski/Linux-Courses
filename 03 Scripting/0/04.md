Here are examples of using single quote, double quote, and backslash in Bash:

- Single Quote ('...'): Preserves the literal value of everything inside. No variable or command substitution occurs.
  Example:

  ```bash
  variable="World"
  echo 'Hello $variable'  # Output: Hello $variable
  ```

  The `$variable` is printed literally without expansion.

- Double Quote ("..."): Preserves most characters but allows variable and command substitution. Example:

  ```bash
  variable="World"
  echo "Hello $variable"  # Output: Hello World
  ```

  The `$variable` is expanded to its value.

- Backslash ($$: Escapes the following character, removing its special meaning. Example:
  ```bash
  echo "This is a \$variable"  # Output: This is a $variable
  echo "A quote: \" inside double quotes"
  ```
  The backslash prevents `$` from variable expansion and allows using a literal double quote inside double quotes.

Summary in a Bash script:

```bash
variable="Bash"

echo 'Single quote: $variable'         # literal, no expansion
echo "Double quote: $variable"         # expands variable
echo "Escape \$ and \" with backslash" # shows $ and " literally
```

This explains the basics of how single quotes, double quotes, and backslashes are used in Bash to control string
interpretation and variable substitution.[1][2][3][4]
