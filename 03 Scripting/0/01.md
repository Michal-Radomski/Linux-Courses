Here is a simple example of a bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal

echo "Hello, World!"
```

Explanation:

- The first line `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use the bash interpreter to run this script.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- The `echo` command prints the message "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

This is a classic beginner script to get started with bash scripting.[1][3][5]

Sure! Here's a basic example of a Bash script that:

1. Greets the user.
2. Asks for their name.
3. Creates a backup of a given directory.
4. Logs the activity.

### 🖥️ Example Bash Script: `backup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# backup.sh - A simple backup script

# Prompt for user's name
echo "Hello! What is your name?"
read USER_NAME

# Greet the user
echo "Welcome, $USER_NAME!"

# Prompt for source directory
echo "Enter the full path of the directory you want to back up:"
read SOURCE_DIR

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Error: Directory '$SOURCE_DIR' does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

# Define backup destination
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backup"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_NAME="backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create the backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME" "$SOURCE_DIR"

# Log the backup
LOG_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/backup.log"
echo "[$(date)] Backup of '$SOURCE_DIR' created as '$BACKUP_NAME'" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Completion message
echo "Backup completed! File saved to $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME"
```

### ✅ How to Use

1. **Save the script** to a file, e.g., `backup.sh`.
2. **Make it executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh
   ```

3. **Run it**:

   ```bash
   ./backup.sh
   ```

Let me know if you want a version that backs up multiple directories, supports remote storage, or runs on a schedule (via
`cron`).

Here's a simple Bash script example that checks if a file exists and displays some system information:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment
echo "System Information Script"

# Store current date in a variable
CURRENT_DATE=$(date)

# Print system information
echo "Current Date and Time: $CURRENT_DATE"
echo "Username: $USER"
echo "Current Directory: $PWD"

# Check if a file exists
FILE_TO_CHECK="example.txt"

if [ -f "$FILE_TO_CHECK" ]; then
    echo "$FILE_TO_CHECK exists!"
else
    echo "$FILE_TO_CHECK does not exist."
    echo "Creating $FILE_TO_CHECK..."
    touch $FILE_TO_CHECK
fi

# Display disk usage
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h

# End of script
echo "Script execution completed!"
```

This script:

1. Starts with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) to specify it's a Bash script
2. Prints system information (date, username, current directory)
3. Checks if a file named "example.txt" exists
4. Creates the file if it doesn't exist
5. Shows disk usage
6. Uses variables, conditional statements, and basic commands

To use it:

1. Save it with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `sysinfo.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x sysinfo.sh`
3. Run it: `./sysinfo.sh`

Of course! Here are a few examples of Bash scripts, starting from a very basic one and progressing to a more practical and
complex one.

### Example 1: The "Hello, World!" of Bash Scripts (Beginner Friendly)

This is the simplest possible script. It just prints a message to the screen.

#### The Script: `hello.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment. The line above is called a "shebang".
# It tells the system to execute this file using the bash interpreter.

echo "Hello, World!"
echo "This is my first Bash script."
```

#### How to Use It:

1.  **Save the code:** Open a text editor, copy the code above, and save it in a file named `hello.sh`.

2.  **Make it executable:** In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run this command. This
    gives your script permission to be executed.

    ```sh
    chmod +x hello.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```sh
    ./hello.sh
    ```

#### Expected Output:

```
Hello, World!
This is my first Bash script.
```

### Example 2: A Simple Backup Script (Intermediate)

This script is more practical. It takes a source directory and a destination directory as arguments and creates a compressed
timestamped backup of the source.

#### The Script: `backup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A simple script to back up a directory to a .tar.gz archive.

# --- Configuration ---
# Get the source and destination directories from the command-line arguments
SOURCE_DIR=$1
DEST_DIR=$2

# Get the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# --- Input Validation ---
# Check if the user provided exactly two arguments
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <source_directory> <destination_directory>"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the source directory exists
if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Error: Source directory '$SOURCE_DIR' not found."
    exit 1
fi

# --- Main Logic ---
# Create the destination directory if it doesn't already exist
mkdir -p "$DEST_DIR"

# Create the backup filename
FILENAME="backup-$(basename "$SOURCE_DIR")-$DATE.tar.gz"

# Create the compressed archive
echo "Creating backup of '$SOURCE_DIR'..."
tar -czf "$DEST_DIR/$FILENAME" "$SOURCE_DIR"

# Check if the tar command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful! File saved to: $DEST_DIR/$FILENAME"
else
    echo "Error: Backup failed."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Done."
```

#### How to Use It:

1.  **Save the code:** Save it as `backup.sh`.
2.  **Make it executable:** `chmod +x backup.sh`
3.  **Run it with arguments:** Provide the source and destination directories.
    ```sh
    # This will back up your 'Documents' folder into a 'backups' folder
    ./backup.sh /home/user/documents /home/user/backups
    ```

#### Expected Output:

```
Creating backup of '/home/user/documents'...
Backup successful! File saved to: /home/user/backups/backup-documents-2023-10-27.tar.gz
Done.
```

### Example 3: A Log File Analyzer (Advanced/Practical)

This script analyzes a web server log file (in a common format) to find the top 10 IP addresses by request count and the top
10 requested URLs. It demonstrates functions, better argument handling, and using powerful command-line tools like `awk`,
`sort`, and `uniq`.

#### The Script: `log_analyzer.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A script to analyze a web server log file.
# It finds the top IP addresses and top requested URLs.

# --- Functions ---
show_usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 -f <logfile>"
    echo "  -f    Path to the log file to analyze."
    exit 1
}

analyze_log() {
    local logfile=$1

    echo "--- Log Analysis for: $logfile ---"

    # 1. Find the top 10 IP addresses by request count
    echo -e "\n[Top 10 IP Addresses by Request Count]:"
    awk '{print $1}' "$logfile" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10

    # 2. Find the top 10 requested URLs
    echo -e "\n[Top 10 Requested URLs]:"
    # This awk command handles both GET and POST requests
    awk '{print $7}' "$logfile" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10

    # 3. Find the count of HTTP status codes
    echo -e "\n[HTTP Status Code Counts]:"
    awk '{print $9}' "$logfile" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

    echo -e "\n--- Analysis Complete ---"
}

# --- Main Script Logic ---
# Check if no arguments were provided
if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
    show_usage
fi

# Parse command-line options
while getopts "f:" opt; do
    case $opt in
        f)
            LOG_FILE="$OPTARG"
            ;;
        \?)
            echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2
            show_usage
            ;;
    esac
done

# Check if the log file was provided and exists
if [ -z "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: Log file not specified."
    show_usage
fi

if [ ! -f "$LOG_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$LOG_FILE' not found."
    exit 1
fi

# Run the analysis
analyze_log "$LOG_FILE"
```

#### How to Use It:

1.  **Save the code:** Save it as `log_analyzer.sh`.
2.  **Make it executable:** `chmod +x log_analyzer.sh`
3.  **Create a sample log file** (or use a real one if you have one). Create a file named `access.log`:
    ```
    192.168.1.1 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:36 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
    10.0.0.5 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:37 +0000] "GET /about.html HTTP/1.1" 200 2048
    192.168.1.1 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:38 +0000] "POST /api/data HTTP/1.1" 201 512
    8.8.8.8 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:39 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
    192.168.1.1 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:40 +0000] "GET /contact.html HTTP/1.1" 404 256
    10.0.0.5 - - [10/Oct/2023:13:55:41 +0000] "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
    ```
4.  **Run it with the `-f` flag:**
    ```sh
    ./log_analyzer.sh -f access.log
    ```

#### Expected Output:

```
--- Log Analysis for: access.log ---

[Top 10 IP Addresses by Request Count]:
      3 192.168.1.1
      2 10.0.0.5
      1 8.8.8.8

[Top 10 Requested URLs]:
      3 /index.html
      1 /about.html
      1 /contact.html
      1 /api/data

[HTTP Status Code Counts]:
      4 200
      1 201
      1 404
