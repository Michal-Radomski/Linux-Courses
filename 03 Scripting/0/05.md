Here are examples of integer arithmetic in Bash:

1. Using Arithmetic Expansion with $(( ... )):

```bash
a=10
b=3

echo $((a + b))  # Addition: 13
echo $((a - b))  # Subtraction: 7
echo $((a * b))  # Multiplication: 30
echo $((a / b))  # Division: 3
echo $((a % b))  # Modulus: 1 (remainder)
```

2. Using let command:

```bash
let result=a+b
echo $result  # Output: 13

let "result = a * b"
echo $result  # Output: 30
```

3. Using expr command:

```bash
sum=$(expr $a + $b)
echo $sum  # 13

mul=$(expr $a \* $b)  # Note the escaped *
echo $mul  # 30
```

Notes:

- Arithmetic expansion $(( ... )) is the most common and recommended method for integer math in Bash.
- The let command is another way to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
- The expr command is an older external command to perform integer arithmetic but is less efficient.
- Bash supports typical arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, %, and also \*\* (power).

Example putting it together:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
a=10
b=3

echo "Sum: $((a+b))"
let diff=a-b
echo "Difference: $diff"
product=$(expr $a \* $b)
echo "Product: $product"
```
