The difference between `else` and `elif` in bash conditional statements is as follows:

- `else` is used to specify a block of code that runs if none of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions are true. It acts as
  a "default" or fallback option and does not take a condition.
- `elif` (short for "else if") is used to check an additional condition if the preceding `if` or `elif` condition was false.
  It allows testing multiple conditions sequentially before falling back to the `else` block.

For example:

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
  # runs if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
  # runs if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
else
  # runs if both condition1 and condition2 are false
fi
```

So, `elif` introduces another conditional test, while `else` handles all remaining cases where none of the tested conditions
apply.

This allows bash scripts to handle multiple branches of logic cleanly and efficiently.[1][2][7]
