The `local` keyword in Bash is used to declare a variable with local scope inside a function. This means the variable exists
only within that function and is not accessible outside of it.

### Difference Between `x=5` and `local x=5`

- `x=5` declares or assigns the variable `x` globally (or in the current scope). If done inside a function, `x` can be
  accessed and modified outside the function as well.
- `local x=5` declares `x` as a local variable inside a function, restricting its visibility and lifetime to that function
  only. Changes to `x` inside the function will not affect any global variable with the same name.

### Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

x=10  # global variable

my_func() {
  local x=5  # local variable in function
  echo "Inside function: x = $x"
}

my_func
echo "Outside function: x = $x"
```

Output:

```
Inside function: x = 5
Outside function: x = 10
```

Here, the local `x` inside the function does not override or change the global `x` outside the function.

Using `local` helps avoid naming conflicts and accidental modification of global variables in larger scripts or
functions.[1][3][5]
