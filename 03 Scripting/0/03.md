The commands sed and awk are powerful text processing tools used in Unix/Linux environments, but they serve different
purposes:

- sed (stream editor) is mainly used for transforming text in a stream or file. It performs text substitutions, deletions,
  insertions, and simple pattern matching in a non-interactive way. Its strength lies in efficiently performing basic editing
  and substitution operations on large amounts of text.
- awk is a full-fledged programming language designed for pattern scanning and processing. It is used for extracting,
  manipulating, and reporting data from text files, especially when working with columns or fields of data. awk supports
  complex operations, built-in variables, arithmetic, conditional logic, and associative arrays.

In simple terms, sed specializes in quick, straightforward text transformations like replacing strings, while awk excels at
processing structured text data, filtering, and generating reports with logic more akin to programming.[1][2][4][5]

Summary:

- sed: Stream editor for substitution, deletion, insertion.
- awk: Programming language for data extraction, manipulation, complex processing.
