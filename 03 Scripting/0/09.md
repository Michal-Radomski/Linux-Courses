Here is an example of testing logical OR (-o) in bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a letter: " letter

if [ "$letter" = "a" -o "$letter" = "b" ]; then
  echo "The letter is either a or b."
else
  echo "The letter is not a or b."
fi
```

Explanation:

- The `-o` operator represents logical OR in the test `[ ... ]`.
- The condition checks if the variable `letter` is equal to `"a"` OR equal to `"b"`.
- If either condition is true, it prints the first message; otherwise, the else branch runs.

Alternatively, using the newer syntax with `[[ ... ]]` and `||` operator is preferred in modern bash:

```bash
if [[ "$letter" == "a" || "$letter" == "b" ]]; then
  echo "The letter is either a or b."
else
  echo "The letter is not a or b."
fi
```

Both accomplish logical OR testing in bash conditionals.[1][2][5]
