An example of content for the cgi-bin directory in Apache2 typically consists of executable scripts that act as CGI programs.
These scripts can be in languages like Perl, Python, or Bash. A classic simple example is a Perl script named `first.pl` that
outputs "Hello, World." Here is what the content might look like for such a script:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello, World.";
```

This script starts with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/perl` indicating the interpreter, then prints the HTTP content-type header
followed by a blank line, and finally the simple message body.

The directory might also have other CGI scripts with extensions such as `.cgi`, `.py`, or `.sh`. These scripts need to have
executable permissions (e.g., chmod 755) and be located typically in `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/` or `/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/`
depending on the Apache configuration.

Here is a Bash example script you might find in cgi-bin:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ""
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello from Bash CGI script!</h1></body></html>"
```

And a Python example script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Content-type:text/html")
print()
print("""
<html><head></head><body>Python CGI script running!</body></html>
""")
```

The Apache configuration uses the `ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /path/to/cgi-bin/` directive to map requests for `/cgi-bin/` URLs to
this directory so it treats everything inside as executable CGI scripts.

In summary, typical cgi-bin directory content is a set of executable script files that produce HTTP response output, such as
the above Perl, Bash, or Python examples.[1][2][5][8][9]
