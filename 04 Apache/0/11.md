To display `index.php` by default in Apache, you need to configure Apache to recognize `index.php` as a directory index file.
This means Apache will automatically serve `index.php` when a user accesses a directory without specifying a file.

Here are the steps:

1. Open your Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or your site-specific config).

2. Locate the `DirectoryIndex` directive. It might look like:
   ```
   DirectoryIndex index.html
   ```
3. Modify or add the directive to include `index.php` at the beginning:

   ```
   DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm
   ```

   This makes Apache look for `index.php` first.

4. If you do not have access to the main config, create or edit a `.htaccess` file in your web root directory and add:
   ```
   DirectoryIndex index.php
   ```
5. Ensure the PHP module is enabled in Apache to process `.php` files.

6. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```
   or
   ```
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

After this setup, when you visit a directory URL, Apache will serve `index.php` automatically if it exists, displaying your
PHP page.

This configuration avoids the need for explicitly typing `index.php` in the URL and ensures a smooth user experience on
PHP-based sites.[1][2]
