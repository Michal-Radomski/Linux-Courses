A .key file in the context of Apache SSL configuration is the private key file. It contains the private cryptographic key
used to decrypt information encrypted with the public key. This key must be kept secure and private because it is essential
for establishing secure SSL/TLS connections. The private key corresponds to the public key embedded in the SSL certificate.

A .cert file (or certificate file) contains the public part of the SSL certificate, which includes the public key and
identity information about the certificate owner. This certificate is sent to clients (browsers) during the SSL handshake to
enable encrypted communication.

Together, the .key file and the .cert file allow the Apache server to encrypt data sent to clients and decrypt data received
securely. The .key file remains private on the server, while the .cert file is shared publicly through the SSL
handshake.[1][2][4]
