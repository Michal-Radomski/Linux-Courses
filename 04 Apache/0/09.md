To enable the Indexes option in Apache (httpd), which allows directory listings when no index file is present, you need to
use the `Options +Indexes` directive.

Here are the actionable steps:

1. Locate and open your Apache configuration file such as `httpd.conf` or the site-specific config file (e.g.,
   `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or a virtual host file).

2. Inside the relevant `<Directory>` block for the directory you want to enable indexes for, add or modify the line to:

   ```
   Options +Indexes
   ```

   This enables automatic directory listings.

3. If you want to enable it for a specific folder, you can also use a `.htaccess` file in that folder with this line:

   ```
   Options +Indexes
   ```

4. You can customize the directory listing further with the `IndexOptions` directive for features like FancyIndexing,
   HTMLTable, etc.

5. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```
   service apache2 restart
   ```

This setup allows Apache to generate and show directory listings if no index file (like index.html) is found in the
directory, helping users browse file contents directly through the web browser.[1][2][3]
