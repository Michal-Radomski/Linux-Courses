The main difference between .html and .htm file extensions is historical and related to legacy system limitations. Both serve
the same purpose: they represent files containing HyperText Markup Language used to structure web pages, and modern web
browsers treat them identically by rendering the same content.

The .html extension is the standard and more common today because it represents the full abbreviation of HyperText Markup
Language. On the other hand, .htm originated as a workaround because older operating systems like MS-DOS and early Windows
could only handle three-character file extensions, so .htm was used for compatibility.

Practically, .html is preferred in most web development environments now, whereas .htm might still be encountered in older or
legacy systems. There is no difference in performance, security, or how browsers interpret these files. The choice between
them mainly comes down to legacy compatibility and convention, with .html being the modern standard.[3][6][8]
