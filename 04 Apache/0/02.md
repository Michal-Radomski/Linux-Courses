The difference between httpd and apache2 lies mainly in naming conventions and operating system context, but both refer to
the Apache HTTP Server:

- Apache2 is the name typically used for the Apache HTTP Server Version 2.x, developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It
  is the open-source web server software that processes HTTP requests and serves web content.
- Httpd stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon, which refers to the actual server program (daemon) running in
  Unix/Linux systems that responds to HTTP requests. The term httpd is often used interchangeably with Apache on Unix-like
  systems.

Key distinctions:

- On Windows systems, the server commonly runs as a service named Apache.
- On Unix/Linux, the server runs as a daemon named httpd.
- Configuration file names differ by distribution: on Red Hat/CentOS, the Apache config file is typically
  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, whereas on Debian/Ubuntu, it is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
- The terms basically refer to the same underlying software but with differences in naming conventions, daemon/service
  naming, and configuration conventions depending on the OS and distribution.[1][2][5]

In summary, "httpd" emphasizes the daemon process in Unix/Linux, while "apache2" refers more to the Apache HTTP Server
software version 2.x or the package name, especially in Debian-based systems.
