The terms "php-mysql" and "php-mysqlnd" refer to different MySQL drivers used by PHP to connect and interact with MySQL
databases.

- The "php-mysql" extension uses the older MySQL Client Library (libmysql) to connect PHP with MySQL. It is a more generic C
  client library, not tightly integrated with PHP.
- The "php-mysqlnd" stands for MySQL Native Driver for PHP, which is a drop-in replacement for the MySQL Client Library.
  Mysqlnd is highly optimized and tightly integrated into PHP, using PHP's memory management, string handling, and streams
  for better performance and features.

Mysqlnd also offers advantages like asynchronous queries, performance statistics, plugin API, and no need to install the
MySQL Client Library separately. Since PHP 5.4, mysqlnd is the default driver for all PHP MySQL extensions including
ext/mysqli and PDO_MySQL.

In summary:

- php-mysql: Uses the older, generic MySQL client library.
- php-mysqlnd: The modern, native driver built specifically for PHP, with better integration and performance.

Mysqlnd is recommended over the older library for new development and is the default in modern PHP versions.[2][4][6]
