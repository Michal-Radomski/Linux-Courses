To configure Apache to allow access from an IP range and deny access from another IP range, the modern approach (Apache 2.4
and later) uses the `Require` directive inside the configuration file or `.htaccess`. You can use `<Directory>`,
`<Location>`, or `<VirtualHost>` blocks depending on where you want the restriction applied.

Example configuration:

```apache
<Directory /path/to/directory>
    # Allow access to this IP range
    Require ip 192.168.1.0/24

    # Deny access to this IP range
    <RequireAll>
        Require all granted
        Require not ip 203.0.113.0/24
    </RequireAll>
</Directory>
```

Explanation:

- `Require ip 192.168.1.0/24` allows access only to IPs in this range.
- `<RequireAll>` combined with `Require all granted` and `Require not ip` denies the specified IP range while allowing
  others.
- You can also explicitly deny particular IPs using `Require not ip` inside `<RequireAll>` block when you want to allow most
  but deny specific ranges.

After editing, restart Apache to apply changes.

This method is preferred over older `Order`, `Allow`, and `Deny` directives, which are deprecated. For older Apache versions
(2.2 and prior), directives like:

```apache
Order deny,allow
Deny from 203.0.113.0/24
Allow from 192.168.1.0/24
```

were used, but are now obsolete.

In short, for most up-to-date Apache versions, use the `Require` directive with `ip` and `not ip` for allow and deny
respectively.[1][2][3][4][5]
