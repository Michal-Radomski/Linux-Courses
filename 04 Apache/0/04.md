The main difference between Apache and Nginx lies in their architecture and how they handle client requests. Apache uses a
process-driven, modular architecture with multiple processing models like prefork, worker, and event, which handle requests
by spawning processes or threads. Nginx, on the other hand, employs an asynchronous, event-driven architecture that can
handle many requests simultaneously with a single or few worker processes. This makes Nginx generally faster and more
efficient in handling static content and high traffic loads, while Apache is more flexible and better suited for serving
dynamic content and shared hosting environments.[1][3][8]

Here are key differences summarized:

| Feature         | Apache                                                | Nginx                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Architecture    | Modular, process-driven (prefork, worker, event)      | Asynchronous, event-driven                              |
| Static Content  | Uses caching modules separately                       | Built-in efficient caching system                       |
| Dynamic Content | Integrates language processors directly via modules   | Passes requests to external processes (proxying)        |
| Modules         | Over 50 dynamically loadable, including third parties | Over 100 third-party, but mostly static compiled        |
| Configuration   | Supports .htaccess for directory-level configs        | No .htaccess, but supports modular config files         |
| Performance     | Less efficient for very high concurrency              | Highly efficient handling many simultaneous connections |
| Use Case        | Better for shared hosting and dynamic content         | Excels at static file serving and reverse proxying      |

Apache tends to be more flexible due to dynamic module support and .htaccess file use, which allows directory-level
configuration. Nginx, focusing on efficiency and scalability, is often used as a front-end proxy server to handle static
content and pass dynamic requests to back-end servers.[5][6][8][1]
