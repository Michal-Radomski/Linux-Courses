To enable redirects in Apache (httpd), the most straightforward way is using the `Redirect` directive from the `mod_alias`
module, or for more complex scenarios, using `mod_rewrite`.

Here are the practical steps to enable redirects:

1. Simple Redirect:

   - In your Apache configuration file (e.g., in the relevant `<VirtualHost>` block), add a line like:
     ```
     Redirect 301 /old-path http://example.com/new-path
     ```
   - This permanently redirects requests from `/old-path` to the specified new URL.

2. Using `.htaccess`:

   - If you cannot edit the main config, you can put the same `Redirect` directive in a `.htaccess` file inside the directory
     to redirect from there.

3. For more flexible or conditional redirects, enable and use `mod_rewrite`:

   - Enable it via:
     ```
     sudo a2enmod rewrite
     sudo systemctl reload apache2
     ```
   - Then add rules in your config or `.htaccess` like:
     ```
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^old-directory/(.*)$ /new-directory/$1 [R=301,L]
     ```
   - This rewrites URLs matching the pattern, supporting dynamic redirects.

4. Restart or reload Apache after any configuration changes:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

In summary, use `Redirect` for simple static redirects and `mod_rewrite` for complex patterns and conditions. Both methods
require correct placement inside Apache configuration or `.htaccess` files and proper module enabling.[1][3][6]
