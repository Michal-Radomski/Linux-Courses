When using apt-get on Ubuntu, suggested packages are not installed by default when you install a package. To install the
suggested packages automatically along with the main package, you can use the option --install-suggests with apt-get. For
example:

```
sudo apt-get install --install-suggests package_name
```

If you want to install only specific suggested packages, you have to install them individually by name like any other
packages.

In summary:

- To install all suggested packages: use `--install-suggests` flag with apt-get install.
- To install only some suggested packages: install them individually by name.

This is the standard way to handle suggested packages in apt-get on Ubuntu.[1][3][4]
