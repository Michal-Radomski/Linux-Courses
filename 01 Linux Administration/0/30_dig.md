The dig command in Ubuntu is used for DNS lookup purposes. It stands for Domain Information Groper and helps query DNS name
servers to retrieve DNS records such as IP addresses (A and AAAA records), mail exchange servers (MX), canonical names
(CNAME), name servers (NS), and more. It is commonly used to troubleshoot DNS issues, verify DNS server responses, check DNS
propagation, and diagnose network connectivity problems related to DNS.

The command provides detailed information about DNS queries and is favored for its flexibility, clear output, and ease of
use. By default, dig queries A records if no type is specified. It can be used with options to specify DNS servers, query
types, and to customize output.

In summary, dig is a crucial tool for system administrators and developers to perform DNS lookups and troubleshoot
DNS-related issues on Ubuntu.[1][2][3][4][5][6]
