The `source` command in Linux is used to read and execute commands from a specified file within the current shell
environment. Unlike running a script normally, which executes in a new subshell, `source` allows the commands in the file to
affect the current shell session, meaning that any variables, functions, or environment changes in the file will persist
after the command completes. This makes it especially useful for loading environment variables, shell functions, or
configuration settings into the current session without starting a new shell. The syntax is usually `source filename` or
`. filename`.[1][2][3]
