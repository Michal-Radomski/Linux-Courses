The `resize2fs` and `e2fsck` commands are utilities used for managing ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems in Linux:

- **resize2fs** is a tool to resize an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem, allowing you to either expand or shrink the filesystem size
  to match the underlying block device size. It can be used on mounted filesystems for expansion (if supported) or on
  unmounted filesystems for shrinking. Before shrinking, the filesystem must be unmounted. This command adjusts only the
  filesystem size, not the partition itself, so partition resizing tools like `fdisk` or `parted` must be used separately to
  modify the partition size. Always run filesystem checks before resizing. Example:

  ```
  resize2fs /dev/sda1       # expand filesystem to fill partition
  resize2fs /dev/sda1 20G   # shrink filesystem to 20 GB (unmounted)
  ```

- **e2fsck** is a filesystem check utility for ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems that verifies and repairs filesystem integrity
  issues. It's similar to `fsck` but specifically for these extended filesystems. Running `e2fsck` before resizing or
  mounting filesystems is recommended to prevent data corruption and ensure the filesystem is consistent.

In summary, `resize2fs` changes the size of the filesystem itself, while `e2fsck` checks and repairs filesystem health and
consistency, often used before resizing operations.[1][2][3][4]
