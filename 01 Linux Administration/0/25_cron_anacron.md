The key difference between cron and anacron lies in how they handle scheduled jobs when the system is not running:

- Cron assumes the system is continuously running and runs scheduled jobs at specific times. If the system is off at the
  scheduled time, the job will not run. It is suitable for always-on servers and provides minute-level precision for
  scheduling.

- Anacron is designed for systems that are not always on, such as laptops or desktops. It runs scheduled jobs that were
  missed while the system was off, as soon as the system is powered on again, but only with a minimum time granularity of one
  day.

In summary, cron is ideal for time-sensitive tasks on always-on systems, while anacron ensures periodic tasks are still
executed on systems with intermittent uptime but with less precise timing.[1][3][5]
