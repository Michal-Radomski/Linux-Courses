dmesg and journal are both tools used for viewing system logs in Linux, though they serve slightly different purposes and
provide access to different kinds of logs.

### dmesg

- dmesg stands for "diagnostic message" or "display message."
- It displays the kernel ring buffer messages, which include kernel-related logs about hardware, drivers, and system startup.
- It's useful for troubleshooting hardware errors, driver issues, and system boot problems.
- Example usage:
  - `dmesg` shows all kernel messages.
  - `dmesg | less` lets you scroll through the messages.
  - `dmesg -T` displays timestamps in a human-readable format.
  - `dmesg -l err` filters messages to show only errors.
- The kernel buffer is limited in size, so older messages may get overwritten.

### journal (systemd journal)

- The journal is part of systemd and stores system logs more comprehensively than dmesg.
- It includes logs not only from the kernel but also from user space services, applications, and the whole system.
- It stores logs persistently (usually on disk), and you can query and filter logs by various criteria.
- Typical commands include:
  - `journalctl` to view all logs.
  - `journalctl -k` to view only kernel logs.
  - `journalctl -u <service>` to view logs for a specific service.
  - `journalctl --since today` to view logs starting from today.
- The journal is more powerful and feature-rich than dmesg for general system troubleshooting and monitoring.

In summary, dmesg is mainly for real-time kernel message viewing, while journalctl provides comprehensive, persistent logging
for the entire system. Both are key tools for Linux system administrators.[1][2][3][5][9]
