The `lsmod` command in Linux is used to display the status of kernel modules currently loaded into the Linux kernel. Kernel
modules are pieces of code that can be loaded or unloaded into the kernel as needed, such as device drivers or filesystem
drivers.

When you run `lsmod`, it lists all loaded modules, providing three columns of information:

- **Module**: Name of the kernel module.
- **Size**: The size of the module in bytes.
- **Used by**: Number of instances using this module and the names of dependent modules.

`lsmod` does not take options and provides a convenient snapshot of which kernel modules are active, useful for
troubleshooting hardware issues and verifying driver status.

Example output snippet:

```
Module                  Size  Used by
snd_usb_audio          614400  0
nf_conntrack_broadcast 12288   1 nf_conntrack_netbios_ns
```

In summary, `lsmod` helps you see which kernel modules are loaded and in use on your system, aiding in system diagnostics and
management.[1][2][3][4]

The `udevadm monitor` command in Linux is used to monitor device events in real-time as they happen in the system. It listens
to both the kernel events (uevents) and udev events that occur when devices are added, removed, or change state. This command
helps administrators and developers observe how the system detects and processes hardware devices, useful for debugging
hardware issues or verifying udev rule behavior.

Key aspects of `udevadm monitor`:

- Shows events as they occur, including device add, remove, change, and move events.
- Displays two event streams: kernel events (sent by the kernel) and udev events (after udev daemon processes the kernel
  events according to rules).
- Useful for debugging device recognition, verifying custom udev rules, and understanding device initialization.
- Usually run with superuser privileges (`sudo udevadm monitor`) to access detailed event information.
- Supports options like `--kernel` (to show only kernel events), `--udev` (to show only udev events), and `--property` (to
  display device properties with events).

In summary, `udevadm monitor` provides live tracking of device-related actions from kernel detection through udev processing,
helping troubleshoot and analyze how devices are managed on a Linux system.[1][2][3]
