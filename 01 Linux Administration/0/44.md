GRUB chain loading is the process where the GRUB bootloader loads another bootloader instead of directly loading an operating
system kernel. Essentially, GRUB hands off control to a second bootloader, which then boots the target OS. This method is
used to boot operating systems that do not have native multi-boot support or when you want GRUB to load an OS through its
existing bootloader.

For example, when dual-booting Windows and Linux, GRUB often "chainloads" the Windows bootloader by pointing to the Windows
bootloader location (on the EFI system partition or MBR). GRUB loads that bootloader code, which then boots Windows. This is
necessary because Windows does not have direct support for being booted by other loaders.

In BIOS systems, chain loading usually means loading the boot sector (first sector) of a partition or disk and jumping to it.
In UEFI systems, it means loading the appropriate EFI executable (e.g., `bootmgfw.efi` for Windows).

A typical GRUB chainloading entry might look like this:

```
menuentry "Windows" {
    insmod chain
    insmod ntfs
    set root=(hd0,1)
    chainloader +1
}
```

Here, `chainloader +1` instructs GRUB to load and execute the first sector of the specified partition.

In UEFI mode, it might look like:

```
menuentry "Windows UEFI" {
    insmod fat
    set root=(hd0,gpt1)
    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}
```

In summary, GRUB chain loading is a technique to load another bootloader from a partition or EFI file, enabling GRUB to hand
off boot management to other OS bootloaders when direct loading is impractical or unsupported.[1][2][3]
