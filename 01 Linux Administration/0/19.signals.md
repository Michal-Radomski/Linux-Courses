The most usable signals from the `kill -l` output (the signal list) for the kill command are:

- SIGTERM (15): Terminates the process gracefully, allowing it to clean up. This is the default signal sent by kill.
- SIGKILL (9): Forces the immediate termination of the process without cleanup. This signal cannot be caught or ignored.
- SIGINT (2): Interrupts the process, equivalent to pressing Ctrl+C in a terminal.
- SIGHUP (1): Hangup signal, often used to reload configuration or restart a process.
- SIGQUIT (3): Similar to SIGINT but also creates a core dump.
- SIGSTOP (19): Suspends the process execution, can be resumed later.
- SIGCONT (18): Resumes a stopped process.

These signals cover the majority of typical use cases: gracefully stopping, force killing, interrupting, restarting, pausing,
and resuming processes.

Usage examples:

- `kill -15 <PID>` to terminate politely
- `kill -9 <PID>` to force kill
- `kill -2 <PID>` to interrupt (Ctrl+C)
- `kill -1 <PID>` to hang up (reload)
- `kill -19 <PID>` to stop process
- `kill -18 <PID>` to continue process

These are the essential signals to know for effective process management with the kill command.[1][2][3][6]
