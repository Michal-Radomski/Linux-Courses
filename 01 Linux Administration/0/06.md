The Linux commands "du" and "type" serve different purposes:

1. **du (Disk Usage)**:

   - The `du` command estimates and displays the disk space used by files and directories.
   - Basic syntax: `du [options] [directory/file]`
   - Commonly used options:
     - `-h`: Shows sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB).
     - `-s`: Displays only a total summary for a directory.
     - `-a`: Shows disk usage for all files, not just directories.
     - `--max-depth=N`: Limits the reporting to a certain directory depth.
   - Example: `du -h /home/user` shows disk usage in a human-readable format for the /home/user directory.

2. **type**:
   - The `type` command is used to display how a given command name would be interpreted if typed in the shell.
   - It indicates whether a command is a shell built-in, an alias, a function, or an external executable.
   - Basic usage: `type [command_name]`
   - Example: `type ls` might output "ls is aliased to 'ls --color=auto'" or "ls is /bin/ls".

In summary, `du` reports disk usage for files and directories, while `type` reveals how commands are resolved by the shell in
Linux environments.[1][2][3]
