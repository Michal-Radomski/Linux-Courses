MASQUERADE in the context of iptables is a specific form of Source Network Address Translation (SNAT). It dynamically changes
the source IP address of outgoing packets to the IP address of the network interface through which the packets are leaving.
This is especially useful when the external IP address may change dynamically, such as with DHCP or PPPoE connections,
because MASQUERADE automatically uses the current IP of the outgoing interface.

The primary difference between MASQUERADE and general NAT is that MASQUERADE is a subtype of NAT designed for dynamic IP
environments. Regular SNAT requires specifying a static IP address to translate the source address, while MASQUERADE
dynamically determines the source IP based on the outgoing interface each time a packet leaves. MASQUERADE is typically used
in home or small networks that share a single public IP address among many internal devices, while NAT in general can include
static, dynamic, and port address translation (PAT) types and be applied in broader contexts.

Thus, MASQUERADE is a form of NAT with dynamic source IP handling tailored for interfaces with changing IP addresses, whereas
NAT more generally refers to translation mechanisms that can be static or dynamic depending on configuration.[1][3][7]
