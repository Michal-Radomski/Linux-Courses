A downloaded bash script with +x (executable) permission is not blocked by Linux because Linux trusts that the user has
deliberately allowed execution by setting this permission. The +x permission means the file can be run as a program or
script, but Linux itself does not automatically block or restrict execution based on download origin or content.

This behavior can be dangerous because if a malicious script is granted execute permission and then run, it can perform
harmful actions on the system. However, Linux security relies on user discretion and system policies like mandatory access
control (e.g., SELinux), sandboxing, and antivirus tools to mitigate risks.

In short:

- The +x permission lets the user or others run the script.
- Linux does not automatically block scripts just because they were downloaded.
- Users must be cautious and only execute scripts from trusted sources.
- Additional security layers exist but are not guaranteed by default for all systems.

This is why it is important to review and understand a script before executing it, use least privilege principles, and apply
security best practices in Linux environments to minimize risks from executable files.[1][2][3]
