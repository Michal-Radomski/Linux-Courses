The difference between [[]] and [] in bash scripting in Linux is mainly about functionality, syntax, and compatibility.

- [] (single brackets) is an alias for the test command. It is used for basic tests like comparing strings, files, and
  integers. It requires whitespace around it and more careful quoting of variables. It is more portable across different
  shells and Unix-like systems.

- [[]] (double brackets) is a Bash (and some other modern shells) extension that is more powerful and flexible. It supports
  additional features such as:

  - Logical operators like && and ||
  - Pattern matching and regular expressions
  - Less strict quoting rules (no word splitting or pathname expansion)
  - Improved syntax for complex conditional expressions

- Performance-wise, [[]] is generally faster and more efficient, with less parsing overhead.

- In terms of compatibility, [] works in POSIX-compliant shells, while [[]] is specific to Bash and not guaranteed on older
  or minimal systems.

In summary, [[]] is recommended for Bash scripting due to better readability and advanced features, while [] should be used
if portability to other shells is needed.[1][2][3]
