The directory /dev/pts in Linux is a special virtual filesystem that manages pseudoterminal (PTY) devices. These
pseudoterminals are pairs of master and slave devices used to emulate physical terminals, allowing terminal emulators (like
xterm) and remote shell sessions (like SSH) to interact with user processes as if they were connected to real terminals. Each
terminal window or session is represented as a unique entry under /dev/pts, such as /dev/pts/0, /dev/pts/1, etc.

The /dev/pts filesystem is dynamically created and managed by the kernel, and it holds virtual device files rather than real
files. When a terminal emulator or remote shell starts, the system allocates a new pseudoterminal and provides it through
/dev/pts. The master side usually connects to the terminal emulator or program, while the slave side is used by the user
process to send or receive input/output through the terminal.

In summary, /dev/pts facilitates terminal emulation and remote terminal sessions by providing the interface for
pseudoterminals in Linux systems.[1][2][3][5]
