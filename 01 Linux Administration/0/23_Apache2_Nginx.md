The key differences between Apache2 and Nginx web servers are in their architecture, performance, and use cases:

- Architecture: Apache uses a process-driven or thread-based model where each request is handled by a separate process or
  thread. Nginx uses an event-driven, asynchronous architecture allowing it to handle many concurrent connections efficiently
  with low memory use.

- Performance: Nginx excels at serving static content quickly and handling high traffic volumes with minimal resource
  consumption. Apache performs well with dynamic content because it can run server-side scripts internally via dynamically
  loaded modules.

- Configuration and Flexibility: Apache supports granular configurations with .htaccess files and dynamic module loading,
  making it highly customizable. Nginx has a simpler configuration approach focused on URI-based rules but requires external
  processors (e.g., PHP-FPM) for dynamic content.

- Use Cases: Nginx is preferred for high-traffic static content, acting as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Apache is ideal
  for complex environments needing extensive customization and native dynamic content handling.

- Resource Efficiency: Nginx uses less CPU and memory under load, making it more efficient in cloud or containerized
  environments. Apache may consume more resources under heavy load due to its process/thread model.

In summary, Nginx is optimized for speed, efficiency, and scalability on static content, while Apache offers more flexibility
and native dynamic content support. They can also be used together, with Nginx serving static content and proxying dynamic
requests to Apache.[2][3][5][9][10]
