The "bz2" format in Linux is used for file compression with the bzip2 command. It compresses files to reduce their size using
the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm and Huffman coding, with the compressed files typically having the ".bz2" extension.

### How to use bzip2 in Linux:

- To compress a file:

  ```
  bzip2 filename
  ```

  This compresses the file and replaces it with "filename.bz2".

- To keep the original file after compression:

  ```
  bzip2 -k filename
  ```

- To decompress a file:

  ```
  bzip2 -d filename.bz2
  ```

  or equivalently:

  ```
  bunzip2 filename.bz2
  ```

- To check the integrity of a compressed file without decompressing:

  ```
  bzip2 -t filename.bz2
  ```

- Verbose mode to see more details during compression or decompression:
  ```
  bzip2 -v filename
  ```

You can also use bzip2 to compress tar archives by running:

```
tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 directory/
```

Here, the "j" option tells tar to use bzip2 compression.

bzip2 is widely used due to its higher compression ratio compared to gzip, though it is slower and uses more
memory.[1][2][3][5]
