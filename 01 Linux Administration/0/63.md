The `fdisk` and `mkfs` commands in Linux serve different but complementary purposes related to disk management:

- **fdisk** is a command-line utility used for creating, deleting, modifying, and managing disk partitions. It interacts with
  the partition table on a hard disk and allows for organizing the disk into partitions, which are independent sections of
  the drive. Users can view existing partitions, create new ones, delete old ones, and change partition types. It supports
  different partition table formats like MBR and GPT. For example, `fdisk -l` lists all partitions on disks.

- **mkfs** (make filesystem) is used to create a filesystem on a partition or disk segment. After a partition is created
  using tools like `fdisk`, the partition is raw and must be formatted with a filesystem such as ext4, xfs, or vfat before it
  can store files. The `mkfs` command prepares the partition by writing the filesystem metadata and data structures required
  for data storage and retrieval.

In short, `fdisk` sets up the structure of the disk by dividing it into partitions, and `mkfs` formats those partitions so
they can be used for storing files.

Summary:

| Command | Purpose                          | Example                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| fdisk   | Create/manage disk partitions    | `sudo fdisk /dev/sda`      |
| mkfs    | Create filesystem on a partition | `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1` |

Together, these commands are fundamental steps in preparing a new disk for use in Linux.[1][2][4][7]
