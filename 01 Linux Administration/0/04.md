On Ubuntu, whether it is better to use a swapfile or a swap partition depends on specific needs, but generally, **swapfiles
are now preferred for most use cases** due to their flexibility and nearly equivalent performance compared to swap
partitions.

### Swapfile Advantages

- **Flexibility:** Swapfiles can be resized, created, or deleted easily without repartitioning the disk, making them ideal
  for changing memory needs.
- **Space Efficiency:** They consume disk space within the existing file system and can be grown or shrunk as needed.
- **Performance:** With modern file systems like ext4, swapfiles perform roughly as well as swap partitions.
- **Ease of Management:** Easy to add or remove after installation.

### Swap Partition Advantages

- **Isolation:** Swap partitions are separate from the main filesystem, which reduces fragmentation and interference.
- **Slightly More Predictable Performance:** Particularly on HDDs, swap partitions can be slightly faster due to contiguous
  allocation.
- **Hibernation:** Swap partitions may be preferred or required for full hibernation support in some setups.

### Trade-offs and Considerations

- Swap partitions are less flexible because resizing requires repartitioning, which can be risky and time-consuming.
- Swapfiles historically had performance and fragmentation issues, but these are largely resolved on modern systems.
- Swapfiles use disk space continuously for their defined size, even if little to no swap is used, which can be seen as less
  space-efficient in some contexts.
- Some filesystems (e.g., older versions of btrfs) have limitations or risks when using swapfiles.

### Summary for Ubuntu

Most modern Ubuntu installations default to a swapfile because the performance differences to swap partitions are minimal,
while the flexibility of swapfiles makes them more convenient. If hibernation is needed, a swap partition might be
preferable, though swapfile hibernation is possible with some configuration. Ultimately, swapfile usage is recommended unless
there are specific needs or legacy constraints favoring a partition.
