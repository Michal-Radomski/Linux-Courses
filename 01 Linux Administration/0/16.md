Soft links and hard links in Linux are two ways to create references to files, and each serves different purposes.

### Hard Links

- A hard link is essentially another name for the same file, pointing to the exact same data on the disk (same inode).
- Deleting the original file does not delete the data as long as at least one hard link exists to that data.
- Hard links cannot span across different file systems and cannot link directories (except by a superuser).
- Hard links are fast and make efficient use of disk space.

### Soft Links (Symbolic Links)

- A soft link is a separate file that points to the pathname of another file.
- If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks because it points only to the filename, not the data itself.
- Soft links can link files across different file systems and can link directories.
- They are slightly slower to access and take very little disk space.

### Purpose

- Hard links provide multiple directory entries for the same file data, useful for redundancy without duplicating data.
- Soft links serve as convenient shortcuts or references to files or directories, especially across file systems or for
  directories.

In short, hard links are direct pointers to file data, while soft links are pointers to file names with more flexibility but
less robustness if the original file is removed.[1][2][3]
