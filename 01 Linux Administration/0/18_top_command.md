The line from the top command:

"top - 21:06:49 up 3:09, 1 user, load average: 1,41, 2,02, 2,68"

means the following:

- The current system time is 21:06:49.
- The system has been running (up) for 3 hours and 9 minutes.
- There is currently 1 user logged into the system.
- The load average values represent the average system load during the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively. Here, 1.41 is
  the load average over the last 1 minute, 2.02 over the last 5 minutes, and 2.68 over the last 15 minutes.

Load average indicates the average number of processes that are either running or waiting to run (runnable state) during
these time periods. It measures system demand on CPU resources.

Interpretation of load average depends on the number of CPU cores in the system. Generally, a load average equal to or less
than the number of cores indicates the system is handling the workload well. Values higher than the number of cores indicate
the system might be overloaded or some processes are waiting too long for CPU time. For example, on a single-core system, a
load average of 1.41 means the CPU was slightly over capacity recently. On a multi-core system, this may be normal if the
number is less than the number of cores.

Thus, this line succinctly shows the time, system uptime, current logged-in users, and system load averages for the given
time windows, helping administrators understand system performance trends.[1][3][5][8]
