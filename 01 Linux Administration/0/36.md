Here is a summary of arp-scan and netdiscover commands and usage for network scanning:

arp-scan:

- arp-scan is a command-line tool that uses the ARP protocol to quickly discover live hosts on a local Ethernet network by
  sending ARP requests.
- Command example: `sudo arp-scan -l` to scan the local subnet for active IP and MAC addresses.
- It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2), making it very fast and reliable for local network host discovery.
- It can also specify IP ranges or interface names for scanning.
- arp-scan is generally faster than netdiscover, especially for larger networks, but does not have advanced features beyond
  basic ARP scanning.[2][5]

netdiscover:

- netdiscover is a versatile network discovery tool also based on ARP requests but supports both active and passive scanning
  modes.
- Active mode sends ARP requests continuously until stopped, useful for finding live hosts on the network.
- Passive mode (`-p`) only listens (sniffs) to ARP packets on the network without sending any requests, suitable for stealthy
  scanning.
- Basic active scan command: `sudo netdiscover -i <interface>` scans the subnet associated with the interface.
- The tool allows scanning specific IP ranges, adjusting timing, and output formats.
- netdiscover provides more flexibility with passive scanning and is good for continuous monitoring but may be slower than
  arp-scan.[3][4][2]

Comparison:

- Both tools use ARP for host discovery on local networks, making them quick and reliable for LAN environments.
- arp-scan is usually faster and simpler, ideal for quick scans on larger networks.
- netdiscover offers passive mode and more scanning options, useful for stealth and ongoing network monitoring.
- They complement tools like Nmap, which operates at Layer 3 and offers broader scanning capabilities like ports and
  services.[1][4]

Scanning steps summary using these tools:

1. Identify the network interface to scan on.
2. For arp-scan, run: `sudo arp-scan -l` or specify IP ranges.
3. For netdiscover active scan, run: `sudo netdiscover -i <interface>`
4. For netdiscover passive scan, run: `sudo netdiscover -p -i <interface>`
5. Analyze results for IPs, MAC addresses, and vendors found on the network.

These tools are primarily suited for discovering live hosts in local network environments using ARP requests efficiently and
can be used alone or alongside more detailed scanners like Nmap.arp-scan and netdiscover are network scanning tools that use
ARP requests to discover live hosts on local networks.[4][5][2]

arp-scan:

- Uses ARP protocol at Layer 2 to send ARP requests for quick host discovery on Ethernet LANs.
- Command example: `sudo arp-scan -l` scans the local subnet for active IP and MAC addresses.
- Generally faster and simpler, especially on larger networks, but focused only on ARP scanning.
- Can specify IP ranges or interfaces to scan.[5][2]

netdiscover:

- Versatile ARP reconnaissance tool with active and passive modes.
- Active mode continuously sends ARP requests: `sudo netdiscover -i <interface>`.
- Passive mode listens to network ARP traffic without sending requests: `sudo netdiscover -p -i <interface>` for stealthy
  scans.
- Supports scanning IP ranges, adjusting timing, and output formats.
- Slower than arp-scan but offers more flexibility, including ongoing network monitoring.[2][3][4]

Comparison:

- Both work with ARP for fast, reliable local host discovery.
- arp-scan is faster and straightforward.
- netdiscover offers passive mode and continuous scanning.
- Both complement broader tools like Nmap, which scans at Layer 3 with ports and services.[1][4]

Scanning steps:

1. Identify network interface.
2. For arp-scan: `sudo arp-scan -l` or specify targets.
3. For netdiscover active: `sudo netdiscover -i <interface>`.
4. For netdiscover passive: `sudo netdiscover -p -i <interface>`.
5. Review discovered IPs and MAC addresses.

These tools efficiently map local networks by discovering live hosts using ARP and are used alongside tools like Nmap for
detailed analysis.[4][5][2]
