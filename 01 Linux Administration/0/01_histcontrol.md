The command `echo $HISTCONTROL` in Linux prints the current value of the environment variable HISTCONTROL. This variable
controls how the Bash shell manages command history.

Specifically, HISTCONTROL can be set to values like:

- `ignoredups` - ignore consecutive duplicate commands in the history.
- `ignorespace` - ignore commands that start with a space (so they are not saved in history).
- `ignoreboth` - combines ignoredups and ignorespace.
- `erasedups` - erase all previous duplicates of a command when new one is added.

Thus, `echo $HISTCONTROL` shows how the shell is configured to handle command history filtering or ignoring, helping to keep
the history clean and/or preventing sensitive commands from being saved accidentally.[1][3][4][8]
