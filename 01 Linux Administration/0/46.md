Popular Linux distributions released as server versions without a desktop environment include:

- **Ubuntu Server**: A widely used server edition of Ubuntu that comes without a graphical desktop by default, focusing on
  stability, security, and cloud/server features.

- **Debian**: Provided as a minimal net-install or server image without any graphical environment, known for stability and
  extensive package support.

- **CentOS Stream / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux**: CentOS used to be a leading community rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
  servers; now CentOS Stream, AlmaLinux, and Rocky Linux fulfill this role, all typically installed without a GUI for server
  use.

- **Fedora Server**: A cutting-edge server-focused release of Fedora, targeting advanced server technologies without a
  desktop environment.

- **openSUSE Leap (Transactional Server)**: The server version of openSUSE with options for minimal server installs and
  transactional updates, usually without GUI.

- **Oracle Linux**: An enterprise-grade server OS based on RHEL, with minimal default installation focusing on server
  performance and security.

These server editions focus on command-line interfaces by default to reduce resource usage and increase security, providing
only essential services and allowing users to add a GUI if required later.[1][6][8]
