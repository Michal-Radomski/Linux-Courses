The Linux `ps` command (short for Process Status) is used to display information about currently running processes on the
system. When run without any options, it shows the processes running in the current shell with details such as process ID
(PID), terminal (TTY), CPU time used, and the command that launched the process.

The command `ps aux` is a common way to list all running processes on the system with additional details:

- `a`: shows processes of all users, not just the current user.
- `u`: displays the process's user/owner along with other details.
- `x`: includes processes not attached to a terminal.

Together, `ps aux` provides a comprehensive list of all active processes with columns that typically include user, PID, CPU
and memory usage, start time, terminal, and the command. This command is widely used for monitoring and managing processes on
Linux systems.

### Summary:

- `ps`: Displays processes running in the current shell.
- `ps aux`: Lists all processes on the system with detailed information including user, PID, CPU, memory usage, and more.

These commands help system administrators and users monitor and control system processes efficiently.[1][2][3][4]
