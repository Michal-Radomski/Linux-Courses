The `rev` command in Linux is used to reverse the characters in each line of a string or text. It reads input line by line
and outputs each line with its characters in reverse order. If no file is specified, `rev` reads from standard input;
otherwise, it processes the contents of the given file(s) and writes the reversed output to the terminal.

For example, running:

```bash
echo "hello world" | rev
```

outputs:

```
dlrow olleh
```

This command is useful for simple text processing tasks where reversing the content of lines is needed.

In summary, `rev` reverses the order of characters on each line of text or file input.[1][2][4]
