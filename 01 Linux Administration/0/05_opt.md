The /opt directory in Linux is **reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages**. These are typically
third-party or external software packages that are not part of the base system or not installed via the system's standard
package management tools. The directory structure under /opt usually contains the entire software package in a single
directory tree (e.g., /opt/CompanyApplication), allowing easy installation and removal by simply copying or deleting the
directory.

Unlike /usr/local, which follows a traditional UNIX directory hierarchy splitting files into separate directories (bin, lib,
etc.), /opt allows applications to have their own custom directory structures and may include all necessary files, libraries,
and binaries bundled together. This makes /opt ideal for proprietary software and add-on packages that want to remain
isolated from the systemâ€™s standard directories.

Additionally, /opt software packages may also include configuration files in /etc/opt and variable data in /var/opt. Overall,
/opt is used to keep optional or third-party software separate and organized without interfering with system-managed files.

This usage is defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and has been a long-standing practice in UNIX and Linux
systems.[1][2][3][4]
