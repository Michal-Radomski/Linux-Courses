When upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11, the Windows upgrade process will likely overwrite the MBR or EFI bootloader
with the Windows bootloader, causing the Linux GRUB bootloader to be replaced or hidden. To restore the GRUB bootloader and
regain access to Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1. Modify Boot Order in BIOS/UEFI

- Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup (usually by pressing keys like F2, F10, Delete, or Esc during boot).
- Change the boot priority to set the Ubuntu drive or the GRUB bootloader as the first option instead of the Windows Boot
  Manager.
- Save the changes and reboot. This might bring back the GRUB menu so you can boot Ubuntu.

### 2. Restore GRUB Bootloader Using Ubuntu Live USB

If the GRUB menu does not appear after changing boot order, use an Ubuntu live USB to restore it:

- Boot from an Ubuntu live USB in "Try Ubuntu" mode.
- Open a terminal and identify your Ubuntu partition by running:
  ```bash
  sudo fdisk -l
  ```
- Mount your Ubuntu root partition, replacing `/dev/sdXn` with your Ubuntu partition:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
  ```
- If you have a separate EFI system partition, mount it as well (/dev/sdYn is the EFI partition):
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdYn /mnt/boot/efi
  ```
- Bind necessary directories:
  ```bash
  for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done
  ```
- Chroot into your installed Ubuntu system:
  ```bash
  sudo chroot /mnt
  ```
- Install or reinstall GRUB (for UEFI systems):
  ```bash
  grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=ubuntu --recheck
  ```
- Update GRUB configuration:
  ```bash
  update-grub
  ```
- Exit chroot and unmount file systems:
  ```bash
  exit
  sudo umount /mnt/dev/pts
  sudo umount /mnt/dev
  sudo umount /mnt/proc
  sudo umount /mnt/sys
  sudo umount /mnt/run
  sudo umount /mnt/boot/efi
  sudo umount /mnt
  ```
- Reboot without USB, and GRUB should appear with both Ubuntu and Windows boot options.

### 3. Update GRUB Entries (if Windows entry is missing)

If Windows 11 does not appear in the GRUB menu:

- Boot into Ubuntu.
- Run:
  ```bash
  sudo update-grub
  ```
  This will scan available operating systems and regenerate the GRUB menu including Windows.

This process helps you restore GRUB as the primary bootloader after Windows upgrade changes the bootloader to Windows,
ensuring both OS options are accessible in your dual-boot setup.[1][3][8]
