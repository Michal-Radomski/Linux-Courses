Locking and unlocking a password in Linux refers to disabling or enabling a user's ability to log in using their password.

- Locking a password (e.g., with `passwd -l username` or `usermod -L username`) disables the user's password by placing a
  special character (usually an exclamation mark `!`) in front of the password hash in the `/etc/shadow` file. This
  effectively prevents password-based login, locking the account temporarily without deleting the user.[1][2][3]

- Unlocking a password (e.g., with `passwd -u username` or `usermod -U username`) removes the lock, restoring the password
  and allowing the user to log in again with their existing password. This re-enables password-based authentication for that
  user.[2][3][1]

In summary, locking is a security measure to temporarily disable a user's password login, and unlocking reverses that
restriction, making the account accessible again. The commands require superuser privileges to execute. This is often used
for administrative control over user access.[1][2]
