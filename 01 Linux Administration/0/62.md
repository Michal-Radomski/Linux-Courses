The "loops" you mentioned in the context of `/proc/partitions` likely refers to loop devices, which appear as entries in that
file.

- `/proc/partitions` is a virtual file listing block devices and their partitions. It shows device major and minor numbers,
  the number of blocks, and device names.
- Loop devices are special virtual block devices that allow regular files to be accessed as if they were block devices (e.g.,
  disk partitions).
- They are commonly named `/dev/loop0`, `/dev/loop1`, etc.
- Loop devices are used to mount disk image files, ISO files, or filesystem images without needing physical hardware.
- In `/proc/partitions`, loop devices show up as entries with their respective major and minor numbers and block sizes, just
  like physical disks or partitions.

So, "loops" in `/proc/partitions` means loopback devices, which serve as virtual block devices pointing to disk image files,
useful for mounting and manipulating filesystems inside files.[1][3][6]
