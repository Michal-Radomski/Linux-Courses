The `whereis` and `at` commands serve different purposes in Linux:

- **whereis** is used to locate the binary, source code, and manual page files for a specified command or program. It
  searches standard system directories and quickly shows where these files are located. This is useful for finding where an
  executable or its documentation resides on the system. For example, `whereis ls` might show paths to the `ls` binary, its
  man page, and source files.

- **at** is a command used to schedule a one-time task to be executed at a specified future time. Unlike `cron`, which runs
  recurring jobs, `at` schedules a job to run once at the given time. You specify the time and then enter the commands to
  execute at that time. The job will be executed by the system's job scheduler.

In summary:

| Command | Purpose                                       | Example           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| whereis | Find locations of binaries, source, man pages | `whereis ls`      |
| at      | Schedule a one-time command execution         | `echo "backup.sh" | at 2am` |

These commands help with locating files related to commands and scheduling deferred tasks respectively.[1][2][3][6]
