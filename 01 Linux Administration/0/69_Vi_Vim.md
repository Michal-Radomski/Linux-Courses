Vi and Vim are both text editors used primarily in Unix-like operating systems, but they have some key differences:

- **Vi** is the original Unix visual text editor. It is minimalistic, lightweight, and available by default on almost all
  Unix systems. It operates in multiple modes such as command mode and insert mode but lacks many modern features. Vi is
  efficient and fast but has a steep learning curve with limited customization and no syntax highlighting.

- **Vim** (Vi IMproved) is an enhanced, extended version of Vi that includes numerous additional features. It supports syntax
  highlighting, multiple levels of undo, plugin systems, auto-completion, and scripting capabilities. Vim remains modal like
  Vi but adds more user-friendly and powerful functionality. It is widely used by developers due to these improvements.

Summary of differences:

| Feature         | Vi                           | Vim (Vi Improved)                                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Availability    | Default on most Unix systems | Often needs to be installed                               |
| Feature Set     | Basic editing                | Syntax highlighting, plugins, scripting, better undo/redo |
| Customizability | Very limited                 | Highly customizable                                       |
| Resource Usage  | Minimal                      | Slightly heavier than Vi                                  |
| User Interface  | Minimal                      | Enhanced with visual improvements                         |

In essence, Vim is Vi with many modern features and improvements; Vim is generally recommended for most users today because
of its enhanced capabilities while maintaining Vi's core modal editing.

You can start with Vim directly for a richer experience, but knowledge of Vi basics helps understand Vim
deeply.[1][2][3][4][5]
