The primary differences between Windows ipconfig and Linux ifconfig are:

Operating System:

- ipconfig is used in Windows OS.
- ifconfig is used primarily in Unix-like OS such as Linux and macOS.

Functionality and Usage:

- ipconfig shows IP configuration details of network adapters and can perform actions like renewing and releasing DHCP IP
  addresses, as well as flushing the DNS cache.
- ifconfig is used to configure and display network interfaces, including activating or deactivating interfaces, assigning IP
  addresses, setting netmask and broadcast addresses, changing MAC address, and managing network interface aliases. It does
  not directly support DHCP renew/release or DNS cache flushing.

Information Provided:

- ipconfig displays IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS suffix, DHCP lease info, and IPv6 status.
- ifconfig displays IP address, netmask, broadcast address, MAC address, packet statistics, error counters, and interface
  status (up/down).

Command Context:

- ipconfig includes some features for DHCP and DNS configuration relevant to Windows networking.
- ifconfig offers more extensive control over network interface parameters in Unix-like systems but lacks direct DHCP and DNS
  cache management.

Interface Scope:

- ipconfig shows all network adapters whether active or not.
- ifconfig by default shows configured interfaces and their statuses.

In summary, Windows ipconfig and Linux ifconfig serve related but distinct purposes. ipconfig focuses on viewing and managing
IP configurations and DHCP settings in Windows, while ifconfig is more about detailed network interface configuration and
status in Unix-like systems. Ifconfig is being replaced in Linux by more modern tools like "ip" but is still widely
used.[2][3][4][6][7][8]
