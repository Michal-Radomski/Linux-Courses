Linux, a distro, and the kernel of a distro have distinct but related meanings:

- Linux refers specifically to the kernel, which is the core component of the operating system responsible for managing
  hardware resources, memory, processes, and communication between software and hardware. The kernel acts as the fundamental
  layer of an OS but by itself is not a complete operating system.

- A Linux distribution, often called a distro, is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel. It includes the
  Linux kernel plus a collection of software such as GNU tools, system libraries, package management systems, user interfaces
  (desktop environments or shells), and applications. A distro customizes Linux for specific purposes and user needs,
  packaging everything together to form a usable OS.

- The kernel of a distro is essentially the Linux kernel as mentioned above, but each distro may provide its own customized
  or patched version of the kernel suited to its goals or hardware support requirements. The kernel is the shared core across
  all distros, but distros add different tools, environments, and packages on top of the kernel.

In analogy, Linux is like the engine of a car, the kernel; a Linux distro is like a fully built car manufactured for
different purposes and users, which includes the engine plus the body, interior, and features. The distro's kernel is the
engine at its core, potentially tuned or modified by each distro.

Thus, the Linux kernel is the low-level core software managing hardware; the Linux distro is an operating system built around
that kernel including many additional components to provide a complete user experience tailored to various needs.[1][2][3][4]

The difference between the kernel headers that can be downloaded and the distro kernel itself is as follows:

- The distro kernel (often packaged as "linux-image" or just "linux") is the compiled Linux kernel binary along with its
  modules that the system runs. It is the core executable code controlling hardware and system processes.

- Kernel headers are source files containing declarations and interface definitions for kernel functions, data structures,
  and constants. They are not runnable code but necessary development files. Headers allow user-space programs and external
  kernel modules (like device drivers or virtualization software) to compile and interface correctly with the running kernel.

- The kernel headers package matches the version of the distro kernel but is kept separate. You only need to install the
  headers if you plan to build additional kernel modules or software that interacts closely with the kernel internally.

In short, the distro kernel is the actual running kernel binary, while the kernel headers are development resources that
describe the kernel's interfaces for building compatible modules or programs. Headers are critical for compiling third-party
modules, but not needed just to run the system with the kernel provided by the distro.

Thus, kernel headers complement the distro kernel by providing necessary programming interfaces without containing the
executable kernel code itself.[1][2][3]

When upgrading a Linux distro using apt-get to download linux-headers, the headers package you install corresponds to the new
kernel version. Here's how the headers "change into" or relate to the new kernel:

- The linux-headers package contains the header files that define kernel interfaces, structures, and macros necessary for
  building kernel modules or drivers compatible with that specific kernel version.

- When you upgrade your distro and a new kernel version is installed, the corresponding linux-headers package for that new
  kernel version is also downloaded and installed.

- These headers are installed in directories named after the kernel version (e.g., /usr/src/linux-headers-<kernel-version>)
  so that development tools or modules can build against the exact kernel version running or to be run.

- Essentially, the headers package provides the necessary development files for the upgraded kernel; they don't themselves
  "turn into" the kernel but must match the kernel version to ensure compatibility.

- The process managed by apt-get ensures that the linux-headers package installed matches the upgraded kernel, allowing
  third-party modules or software requiring kernel recompilation to be successfully built for the new kernel.

Therefore, during an upgrade, when the new kernel is installed, apt-get also installs the matching linux-headers package so
that the interface files required for module compilation correspond exactly to the new kernel version. This synchronization
is critical for kernel module compatibility and system stability.[1][2][3]
