The key difference between `--help` and `man` commands in Linux is the level and source of information they provide:

- `--help` is usually an option passed to a command (e.g., `ls --help`) that displays a brief, concise summary of that
  command’s usage, available options, and a short explanation. It is intended to provide a quick reference or cheat sheet for
  how to use the command. This output is typically generated by the command itself.

- The `help` command (specific to shell built-ins like `cd`, `echo`) similarly gives short usage summaries but only for shell
  internal commands.

- The `man` command accesses the system’s manual pages, which are much more detailed and comprehensive documents. Man pages
  cover in-depth explanations, syntax, options, environment variables, examples, and sometimes related files or commands.
  They are usually stored in a standardized location and formatted for easy navigation.

In summary:

- Use `command --help` for quick, concise guidance on usage and options.
- Use `man command` for detailed, official documentation and examples.

The `--help` output is generally shorter and less detailed than the `man` page, which serves as an extensive
reference.[1][2][3]
