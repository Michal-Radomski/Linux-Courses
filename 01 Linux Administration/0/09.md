The `wc` command in Linux stands for "word count" and is used to count lines, words, characters, and bytes in text files or
standard input.

### How `wc` Works:

- By default, running `wc` on a file prints four pieces of information:
  - Number of lines
  - Number of words
  - Number of bytes (or characters)
  - File name (if file is specified)
- If no file is specified, `wc` reads from standard input.

### Common Options:

- `-l`: Counts only lines.
- `-w`: Counts only words.
- `-c`: Counts bytes.
- `-m`: Counts characters (differs from bytes in multi-byte encoded files).
- `-L`: Prints the length of the longest line in the file.

### Example Usage:

```
wc file.txt
# Outputs lines, words, bytes, and file name

wc -l file.txt
# Outputs only the number of lines in file.txt

cat file.txt | wc -w
# Pipe a file's contents and count words
```

The `wc` command is useful for quick text analysis, script automation, and working with pipes in shell scripting.

In summary, `wc` efficiently counts and reports text file metrics such as lines, words, and bytes based on the options
specified.[1][2][4][5]
