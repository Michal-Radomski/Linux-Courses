A shebang in Linux is a character sequence at the very beginning of a script, consisting of the characters `#!` (hash and
exclamation mark). This line tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the script. For example, the line
`#!/bin/bash` instructs the system to run the script using the Bash shell. It is important because it specifies the script's
runtime environment explicitly, ensuring that the correct interpreter executes the script regardless of the user's default
shell. The shebang line is always the first line in the script and is treated as a directive by the system's program loader,
while typically being ignored by the interpreter itself since it treats it as a comment.[1][2][3]
