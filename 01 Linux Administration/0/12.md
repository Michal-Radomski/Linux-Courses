The `exec` command in Linux is a shell built-in used to **replace the current shell process with a specified command or
program, without creating a new process**. When `exec` is used, the running shell process is completely replaced by the new
command, so the original shell ceases to exist, and the new command takes over the same process ID and resources.

### Key purposes of `exec`:

- **Replace the current shell:** Executing a command with `exec` swaps out the shell for the new command, which means no new
  process is spawned.
- **Save system resources:** Because no new process is created, this reduces overhead compared to running a command normally.
- **Modify shell environment:** When used without a command, `exec` can change file descriptors (like redirecting output) for
  the current shell session.
- **Control over shell behavior:** For example, restricting user access by replacing the shell with a limited command, so the
  user never returns to the shell after the command exits.

### Example:

```
exec ls
```

This replaces the current shell with the `ls` command and exits the shell after `ls` completes.

Another example is redirecting all shell output to a file:

```
exec > output.txt
```

This redirects all subsequent output of the current shell to the file `output.txt`.

In summary, `exec` is used primarily to replace the current shell process with another command or to manipulate the current
shell environment without spawning a new process.[1][2][3][4]
