The `exec` command in Linux is a shell built-in used to **replace the current shell process with a specified command or
program, without creating a new process**. When `exec` is used, the running shell process is completely replaced by the new
command, so the original shell ceases to exist, and the new command takes over the same process ID and resources.

### Key purposes of `exec`:

- **Replace the current shell:** Executing a command with `exec` swaps out the shell for the new command, which means no new
  process is spawned.
- **Save system resources:** Because no new process is created, this reduces overhead compared to running a command normally.
- **Modify shell environment:** When used without a command, `exec` can change file descriptors (like redirecting output) for
  the current shell session.
- **Control over shell behavior:** For example, restricting user access by replacing the shell with a limited command, so the
  user never returns to the shell after the command exits.

### Example:

```
exec ls
```

This replaces the current shell with the `ls` command and exits the shell after `ls` completes.

Another example is redirecting all shell output to a file:

```
exec > output.txt
```

This redirects all subsequent output of the current shell to the file `output.txt`.

In summary, `exec` is used primarily to replace the current shell process with another command or to manipulate the current
shell environment without spawning a new process.[1][2][3][4]

The Linux commands cmp, diff, and sha256 are used for different comparison and verification tasks involving files:

1. cmp (compare):

- Purpose: Compares two files byte by byte.
- Usage: Checks if files are identical or finds the first differing byte.
- Exit codes: 0 if files are identical, 1 if different, 2 if error.
- Example:
  ```
  cmp file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
  If files differ, it shows the byte and line number of the first difference. Using the -b flag shows differing bytes:
  ```
  cmp -b file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

2. diff:

- Purpose: Compares files line by line and shows differences in a human-readable format.
- Usage: Useful for comparing text files to see what lines have changed.
- Example:
  ```
  diff file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
  Output shows differing lines and changes to convert one file to another.

3. sha256 (often sha256sum):

- Purpose: Generates SHA-256 cryptographic hash of a file.
- Usage: Used to verify file integrity by comparing hash values.
- Example:
  ```
  sha256sum file1.txt
  ```
  Output is the SHA-256 hash of the file. To verify:
  ```
  sha256sum -c checksum_file
  ```

These tools serve complementary roles: cmp for byte-wise comparison, diff for line-wise text differences, and sha256 for
integrity checks using hashes.[1][3][9][10]
