The main differences between Podman and Docker are rooted in their architecture, security, and usage models:

Podman is compatible with Docker!

- Architecture: Docker uses a central daemon (background service) to manage containers, which requires a root-privileged
  daemon process. Podman is daemonless, running containers as child processes of the CLI, avoiding a central persistent
  daemon.

- Security: Podman supports rootless containers natively, allowing non-root users to run containers securely, reducing attack
  surfaces. Docker requires more configuration for rootless use and typically runs its daemon with root privileges.

- Compatibility: Podman aims to be a drop-in replacement for Docker and supports most Docker CLI commands and Docker images.
  Docker has a mature ecosystem with Docker Compose, Docker Hub, and Docker Swarm.

- System Integration: Podman integrates well with systemd for managing container lifecycles as services. Docker lacks native
  systemd integration.

- Performance: Podman’s daemonless approach can offer faster container startup and lower resource consumption under certain
  conditions. Docker’s daemon may impose more overhead but supports robust container orchestration.

In summary, Podman offers a more secure, daemonless alternative to Docker with native rootless container support and better
system integration, while Docker provides a mature, widely-adopted ecosystem with comprehensive tooling. Choice depends on
specific needs for security, system integration, and tooling.[1][2][4][5][6]

Here are some basic Podman commands to get started:

- `podman --version`: Check the Podman version installed.
- `podman info`: Display system and Podman-related information.
- `podman pull <image>`: Pull a container image from a registry.
- `podman images`: List all local container images.
- `podman run <image>`: Run a command in a new container from the image.
- `podman ps`: List running containers.
- `podman ps -a`: List all containers, including stopped ones.
- `podman stop <container>`: Stop a running container.
- `podman rm <container>`: Remove a container.
- `podman rmi <image>`: Remove an image from local storage.
- `podman logs <container>`: Show logs from a container.
- `podman exec -it <container> <command>`: Execute a command inside a running container.
- `podman build -t <tag> .`: Build a container image from a Containerfile (Dockerfile equivalent).

These commands cover the basic container lifecycle: fetching images, running containers, stopping/removing containers, and
building images.[1][4][7]
