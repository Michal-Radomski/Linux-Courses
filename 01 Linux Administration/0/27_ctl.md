Here is a list of common Linux commands that end with "ctl," including systemctl:

- systemctl: Central tool to manage systemd and services.
- journalctl: Query the systemd journal logs.
- ipctl: Interface or tool related to IP network configuration (less common, specific to some systems).
- nmcli (though not ending with ctl, related to NetworkManager control).
- loginctl: Manage user logins and sessions with systemd.
- hostnamectl: Control the system hostname.
- localectl: Manage system locale and keyboard settings.
- timedatectl: Control system time and date settings.
- netctl: Network profile manager for Arch Linux.
- resolvectl: Manage system DNS resolver settings.

These commands are typically focused on controlling various system services or configurations and are part of system
management utilities in Linux related mostly to systemd or networking.[1][10]
