Here is a description of the Linux desktop environments GNOME, KDE/Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE, LXQt, and LXDE based on
gathered information and knowledge:

- GNOME: A modern, user-friendly desktop environment focused on simplicity and productivity with a clean, streamlined
  interface. It uses the GTK toolkit and provides a consistent user experience with integrated apps. GNOME emphasizes ease of
  use but offers fewer customization options by default.

- KDE/Plasma: A highly customizable, feature-rich desktop environment based on the Qt toolkit. Plasma provides a modern look,
  extensive settings, and a wide array of applications. It balances performance with eye candy effects and is suited for
  users who want to tweak and personalize their desktop extensively.

- Cinnamon: Originally developed by the Linux Mint team, Cinnamon offers a traditional desktop layout combined with modern
  features. It is based on GTK and provides a familiar interface for users coming from Windows. Cinnamon aims to be both
  visually appealing and user-friendly.

- MATE: A continuation of GNOME 2, MATE is a lightweight desktop environment emphasizing stability and classic desktop
  metaphors. It is designed to give users a traditional desktop experience with moderate resource usage, making it suitable
  for older hardware.

- XFCE: A lightweight, fast, and stable desktop environment built using GTK. It focuses on low resource consumption while
  maintaining a visually pleasant and easy-to-use interface. XFCE is suitable for users with older hardware or those wanting
  a simple and efficient desktop.

- LXQt: A lightweight Qt-based desktop environment designed as the successor to LXDE. It aims to provide a modern and fast
  desktop with low resource requirements. LXQt offers modularity and customization while being suitable for
  resource-constrained systems.

- LXDE: (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) A very lightweight, fast, and energy-efficient desktop designed for older or
  resource-limited computers. LXDE uses the GTK 2 toolkit and the Openbox window manager by default, focusing on minimal
  resource usage while providing a full-featured desktop experience. It allows some customization but stays lean for
  performance.[1][2][3]

These desktop environments vary mainly in resource consumption, customization capabilities, and user interface style,
providing options for different hardware capabilities and user preferences.
