Examples of password and passphrase:

### Password Examples

- Shorter and complex strings with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols:
  - G7$vTz9#QpLmX3aB
  - Blue-Cloud!River#29
  - T!gerRuns2@Sunset
  - cXmnZK65rf\*&DaaD

These are random or semi-random combinations designed to be hard to guess but can be difficult to remember without a manager.

### Passphrase Examples

- Longer sequences of memorable words, often easier to recall:
  - HorsePurpleHatRun
  - HorsePurpleHatRunBay
  - Horse Purple Hat Run Bay Lifting
  - legal tiny facility freehand probable enamel

Passphrases are usually made of 4-7 unrelated words and can include spaces or punctuation for added complexity. They are
strong because they are long and less susceptible to brute-force guessing attacks.[1][2][3]

When generating a Public Key Authentication (PKA) key pair, a passphrase is an optional added layer of security used to
encrypt the private key. The passphrase acts like a password that you must enter whenever you use the private key, providing
two-factor protection: possession of the private key file plus knowledge of the passphrase. This prevents unauthorized users
from using the private key even if they gain access to the key file.

Without a passphrase, the private key file itself grants full access, so using a strong passphrase is recommended for
enhanced security.

For example, when generating SSH keys with ssh-keygen, after choosing the file to save the key, the tool prompts for a
passphrase:

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

If a passphrase is entered, the private key is stored encrypted and requires the passphrase to be decrypted and used for
authentication. If left empty, the private key is stored plaintext, easier to use but less secure.[1][2][5][8]

Randomart is a visually distinctive ASCII art representation generated from the fingerprint of a public key when creating a
Public Key Authentication (PKA) key pair, typically during SSH key generation. Instead of relying solely on long, complex
fingerprint strings (hashes) to verify keys, randomart provides an easily recognizable, human-friendly "picture" of the key.

When a public key is generated, a cryptographic hash (fingerprint) of the key is computed. This fingerprint is then
interpreted through an algorithm that maps it into a unique ASCII art pattern â€” the randomart. The idea is that it is easier
for humans to recognize and verify a small visual pattern rather than comparing long hexadecimal or base64 strings. If the
randomart image changes unexpectedly, it can warn a user that the key may have been tampered with or replaced.

The randomart is purely a visualization tool for verification and does not affect the key's security or function.

Example output looks like this:

```
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|E ..o=*o.+o      |
|. .oo+oo...      |
|.... o=..        |
| o+.  o  =       |
|o .oo ooS.       |
|* ...+o  oo      |
|oo..  o+o+o      |
|  .  o+o+o       |
|   .o..          |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

This helps users visually verify SSH host keys or their own key pairs more easily than reading fingerprints.[1][2][3][4]
