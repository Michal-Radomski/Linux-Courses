The `chroot` command in Linux is used to change the apparent root directory for the current running process and its child
processes. This means that the process sees the specified directory as its root (`/`) directory, effectively isolating it
from the rest of the system. This isolated environment is often called a "chroot jail."

### Key Points:

- The process running inside the chroot **cannot access files or directories outside** the new root directory.
- It is used for creating isolated environments for testing or security (e.g., running applications in a restricted sandbox).
- Commonly used in system recovery tasks, such as reinstalling or repairing a bootloader when the system cannot boot
  normally.
- Syntax example:
  ```
  sudo chroot /path/to/new/root /bin/bash
  ```
  This runs a bash shell with `/path/to/new/root` as the root directory.

### Use Cases:

- **System recovery** (e.g., fixing broken systems by accessing the main root filesystem from a live environment).
- **Testing software** within a controlled environment.
- **Reinstalling bootloader** or updating system files when booting directly is impossible.

In essence, `chroot` provides a way to "jail" a process within a subtree of the file system, giving it a limited view of the
filesystem hierarchy.[1][2][3][4]
