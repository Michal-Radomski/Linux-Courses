To add Fedora as a third OS to your Acer laptop already running Windows 10 and Ubuntu, follow these steps to set up a
triple-boot system safely:

### 1. Backup Important Data

- Before modifying partitions or installing another OS, back up all important data from Windows and Ubuntu.

### 2. Prepare Free Disk Space

- In Windows 10, open Disk Management (`diskmgmt.msc`).
- Shrink an existing partition (usually Windows) to free up unallocated space (at least 20-30 GB) for Fedora.
- Do _not_ create a new partition in that space; leave it unallocated for Fedora to use during installation.

### 3. Create Fedora Live USB

- Download the Fedora Workstation ISO from the official Fedora website.
- Use a tool like Fedora Media Writer or balenaEtcher on Windows or Ubuntu to create a bootable USB stick with Fedora.

### 4. Boot Fedora Live USB Installer

- Reboot your laptop, enter the boot menu (usually press F12, F10, or Esc during startup), and select the Fedora USB drive.
- If needed, disable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI settings to allow Fedora boot.

### 5. Install Fedora

- Choose “Install to Hard Drive” from the Fedora live session.
- When prompted for installation destination, select the unallocated free space.
- Use automatic partitioning or manual partitioning to create Fedora root (`/`), swap, and optionally `/home` partitions in
  the free space.
- Fedora's installer will detect Windows and Ubuntu and configure the GRUB bootloader to include all three OSes.

### 6. Complete Installation and Reboot

- Finish the Fedora installation and reboot.
- On reboot, the GRUB menu should appear, listing Fedora, Ubuntu, and Windows.
- If Fedora boots directly without showing GRUB, hold the Shift or Esc key during boot to access the menu.

### 7. Verify Boot Options and OSes

- Boot into each OS to verify proper functionality.
- If Windows or Ubuntu is missing from GRUB, boot into Fedora and run:
  ```
  sudo update-grub
  ```
  or
  ```
  sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
  ```
  depending on Fedora version.

This approach safely adds Fedora as a third OS alongside Windows 10 and Ubuntu on your Acer laptop, with Fedora's installer
handling bootloader integration automatically for easy multiple OS management.[1][2][3]
