The main differences between Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Linux come down to their target audience, package
management systems, release philosophies, and community vs. enterprise focus.

- Debian is a stable, community-driven distribution known for its strict commitment to free software and wide hardware
  support. It uses the APT package manager with DEB packages. Debian prioritizes stability and long-term support, so it
  typically has older but well-tested software versions. It serves as a base for many other distros including Ubuntu.[1][2]

- Ubuntu is derived from Debian and targets general users and beginners. It is more user-friendly with frequent releases and
  commercial backing by Canonical. Ubuntu uses APT with DEB packages and offers better out-of-the-box hardware support. It
  balances new software availability and stability well.[4][7][1]

- CentOS used to be a free rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), targeting enterprise servers with long-term stability.
  It used RPM packages managed with Yum or DNF. CentOS has been replaced by CentOS Stream, which is a rolling-release just
  ahead of RHEL. It favors stability and has older package versions.[2][1]

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a commercially supported, enterprise-grade distribution with paid licensing. It shares
  the core system with CentOS and uses RPM packages with DNF/Yum. It's widely used in enterprise data centers and focuses on
  stability, security, and support.[3][1]

- Fedora is a community-driven, upstream distribution sponsored by Red Hat. It acts as a testing ground for new features and
  technologies that may later be incorporated into RHEL. Fedora uses RPM and DNF package management, tends to have the newest
  software, and targets developers and enthusiasts who want cutting-edge features.[1][4]

| Distribution   | Base             | Package Manager | Release Model                                | Target Audience          | Software Freshness    | Primary Use Case            |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Debian         | Upstream         | APT/DEB         | Stable releases (~2 yrs)                     | Community, servers       | Older, well-tested    | Servers, desktops, embedded |
| Ubuntu         | Debian           | APT/DEB         | Regular (6-month/Long Term Support releases) | Beginners, general users | Recent, stable        | Desktops, servers           |
| CentOS         | RHEL             | YUM/DNF/RPM     | Stable, now CentOS Stream (rolling)          | Enterprises, servers     | Older, stable         | Enterprise servers          |
| Red Hat (RHEL) | Commercial       | YUM/DNF/RPM     | Stable with long support (up to 10 yrs)      | Enterprises              | Older, secure         | Enterprise servers          |
| Fedora         | Red Hat Upstream | YUM/DNF/RPM     | Rapid (~6 months) rolling, cutting-edge      | Developers, enthusiasts  | Latest, bleeding edge | Development, desktop        |

In summary, Debian and Ubuntu are favored for wide usage and community support with Debian emphasizing stability and Ubuntu
user-friendliness. CentOS and Red Hat focus on enterprise-grade stability and support, with Fedora acting as a cutting-edge
testbed for Red Hat technologies.[7][2][3][4][1]
