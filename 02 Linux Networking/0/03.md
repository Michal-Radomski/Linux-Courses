VirtualBox Guest Additions are software packages installed inside a virtual machine (VM) that optimize and improve the
performance and usability of the guest operating system. They include device drivers and system applications that enable
features like seamless mouse integration, better video support with higher and non-standard resolutions, shared folders
between host and guest, clipboard sharing, time synchronization, and seamless window integration. These additions make the
interaction between the host and the guest OS smoother and more efficient.[1][5][7]

To add Guest Additions on Ubuntu running inside VirtualBox, the typical steps are:

1. Update your Ubuntu package indexes:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install necessary prerequisite packages including build tools, kernel headers, and DKMS:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
   ```

3. In the VirtualBox menu of the running Ubuntu VM, go to **Devices** â†’ **Insert Guest Additions CD Image...**. This will
   mount a virtual CD inside the guest.

4. Run the Guest Additions installer script from the mounted CD:

   - You can open a terminal and navigate to the mount directory (typically under `/media/`), then run:
     ```bash
     sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
     ```
   - Optionally right-click and choose Run as program on the autorun script.

5. Reboot the Ubuntu VM to apply changes:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

6. After reboot, you should have enhanced features such as automatic screen resizing, mouse pointer integration, and shared
   clipboard available.

You can verify the installation by checking the service version or kernel modules:

```bash
VBoxService --version
lsmod | grep vboxguest
```

This process significantly improves the user experience when running Ubuntu as a guest OS on VirtualBox.[2][3][4][8]
