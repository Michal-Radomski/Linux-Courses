The notation "192.168.122.0/24" is an example of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, which is a compact way to
represent an IP address and its associated network mask.

- The "192.168.122.0" part is the base IP address or network address.
- The "/24" suffix indicates the length of the network prefix, specifically the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.
- A "/24" means the first 24 bits of the 32-bit IP address are the network part, corresponding to a subnet mask of
  255.255.255.0.
- This defines a subnet that includes all IP addresses from 192.168.122.0 to 192.168.122.255, where the last 8 bits identify
  individual hosts within this subnet.

In simpler terms, "192.168.122.0/24" describes a network containing 256 addresses (192.168.122.0 through 192.168.122.255),
with the first 24 bits fixed for the network, and the remaining bits used for host addresses within that network.[1][2][3]
