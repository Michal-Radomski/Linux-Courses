The cifs-utils package in Linux provides utilities for mounting and managing CIFS (Common Internet File System) network file
systems, which are also known as SMB (Server Message Block) shares. It allows Linux systems to connect to and interact with
Windows shares or other SMB/CIFS-compatible network storage devices. The package includes the mount.cifs command that is used
to mount CIFS filesystems onto the Linux directory tree, among other supporting tools.

In essence, cifs-utils enables Linux to access shared folders on Windows servers, NAS devices, and Samba servers, making
these network shares behave like local file systems for reading and writing files.[1][2][3][4]
