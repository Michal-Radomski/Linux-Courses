VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Daemon) is a secure, fast, and stable FTP server for Linux. It is designed to be lightweight and
secure with features like support for virtual IP addresses, IPv6, and SSL/TLS for secure file transfers, making it popular in
both small and large environments.

Here are the key differences between VSFTPD, FTPS, FTP, and SFTP:

| Feature             | VSFTPD                             | FTP                                      | FTPS                                            | SFTP                                              |

| Definition          | FTP server software                | File Transfer Protocol                   | FTP with SSL/TLS security layer                 | Secure FTP based on SSH                           |
| Security            | Supports SSL/TLS for encryption    | No built-in encryption                   | Encrypts control and data channels with SSL/TLS | Uses SSH for encryption and secure authentication |
| Protocol            | FTP (can be secured with FTPS)     | FTP (no encryption)                      | FTP + TLS/SSL                                   | SSH File Transfer Protocol                        |
| Ports Used          | Standard FTP ports (usually 21)    | 21 for commands, multiple for data       | Similar to FTP but encrypted                    | Single port (usually 22)                          |
| Authentication      | Username/password, SSL certs       | Username/password                        | Username/password, client/server certificates   | SSH keys or username/password                     |
| Use Case            | Secure FTP server implementation   | Legacy file transfers without encryption | Secure file transfers compatible with FTP       | Secure transfers in SSH environments              |
| Firewall Complexity | Moderate to high due to FTP nature | High due to multiple ports               | High due to multiple ports                      | Lower, uses single port                           |

Summary:

- VSFTPD is a secure FTP server software implementing FTP with optional SSL/TLS.
- FTP is the basic, unencrypted file transfer protocol.
- FTPS is FTP secured with SSL/TLS encryption.
- SFTP is a different protocol entirely, running over SSH for secure file transfer.

Each serves different needs depending on security requirements, compatibility, and network configuration.[1][2][4][5][6][7]

To add authentication (username and password) to the FTP link ftp://192.168.1.122 in a browser or other FTP client, the
syntax is:

```
ftp://username:password@192.168.1.122
```

- Replace `username` with your FTP username.
- Replace `password` with your FTP password.
- Special characters in the username or password (like @, :, /) should be URL-encoded to avoid URL parsing issues.

For example, if username is "user1" and password is "mypassword", the URL becomes:

```
ftp://user1:mypassword@192.168.1.122
```

This syntax provides basic authentication inline with the URL so the browser or FTP client can log in automatically when
connecting to the FTP server. However, passing passwords in URLs should be done with caution due to security risks like
password exposure in browsing history or logs.[1][4][5]
