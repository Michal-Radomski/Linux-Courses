The command `dd if=/dev/zero of=small bs=1M count=20` does the following:

- It uses the `dd` utility to copy data.
- `if=/dev/zero` specifies the input file as `/dev/zero`, a special file that provides as many null (zero) bytes as are read
  from it.
- `of=small` specifies the output file as a file named "small."
- `bs=1M` sets the block size to 1 megabyte.
- `count=20` limits the copy to 20 blocks.

Together, this command writes 20 megabytes (20 blocks Ã— 1MB block size) of zero bytes to the file named "small." Essentially,
it creates or overwrites the file "small" with 20 MB of zeroed data.[1][2][3]
