Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for managing Linux servers. It allows users to perform system administration tasks
through a web browser with a user-friendly interface. Some typical tasks include managing network settings, storage,
firewall, user accounts, virtual machines, software updates, system logs, and monitoring system performance such as CPU load
and memory usage. Cockpit is designed to be easy to use for beginners, helpful for admins familiar with Linux, and useful for
experts who want an overview of systems. It runs on demand without using resources when not in use and integrates smoothly
with existing system tools and command-line workflows. It also supports remote management from any major web browser on any
operating system.[1][2][3]
