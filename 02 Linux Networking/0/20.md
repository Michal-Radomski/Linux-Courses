The Linux command "ip a s" is a shorthand for "ip address show." It is used to display information about all IP addresses
associated with all network interfaces on the system. This command shows details such as interface names, IP addresses (both
IPv4 and IPv6), and other related network configuration parameters.

In short:

- "ip" is the main command.
- "a" or "addr" stands for address.
- "s" or "show" is the action to display the addresses.

So, "ip a s" lists all IP addresses assigned to all network interfaces on the machine.[1][9]
