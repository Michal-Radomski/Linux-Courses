The main difference between the Linux commands poweroff and shutdown is in how they operate and their typical use cases:

- The poweroff command directly sends an ACPI signal to the system hardware to power down the machine immediately. It is a
  more direct and immediate command to turn off the system.
- The shutdown command is more versatile and schedulable. It allows specifying a time to power down the system, optionally
  sending warnings to logged-in users. Shutdown also executes system shutdown scripts to safely stop services and processes
  before halting or powering off the machine.

In summary, poweroff is a straightforward command to power off the system, while shutdown is a more controlled and
configurable command that can schedule shutdowns, notify users, and execute proper shutdown procedures before powering off or
halting the system.[1][3][5]
