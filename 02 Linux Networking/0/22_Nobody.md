The "nobody" user in Linux is a special, predefined user account with minimal permissions. It is typically assigned a high
user ID (UID), often 65534, and belongs to a group named "nogroup" or similar. The primary purpose of the nobody user is to
enhance security by running processes and services that do not require any special privileges, thereby limiting the potential
damage if such a process is compromised.

This user is often used in Network File System (NFS) configurations to map root or unknown user requests to a non-privileged
user. It usually cannot be logged into directly because it has no password by design, but administrators can switch to this
user for testing purposes using elevated privileges.

In summary, "nobody" acts as a generic, non-privileged account that holds no files and belongs to no privileged groups,
ensuring strict limitation of capabilities for specific system operations or services to improve security.[1][2][3]
