To install Windows on VirtualBox, follow these general steps:

1. **Install VirtualBox** on your host machine if not already installed.

2. **Download Windows ISO**: Obtain a Windows installation ISO file from the official Microsoft website (for example, Windows
   10 or Windows 11 ISO).

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:

   - Open VirtualBox and click "New".
   - Enter a name for the VM (e.g., "Windows 10").
   - Select the type as "Microsoft Windows" and the version matching your ISO (e.g., "Windows 10 (64-bit)").

4. **Assign Memory (RAM)**:

   - Choose the amount of RAM to allocate to the VM. A minimum of 2-4 GB is recommended, depending on Windows version and
     your hardware.

5. **Create a Virtual Hard Disk**:

   - Choose "Create a virtual hard disk now".
   - Select VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) format.
   - Set dynamically allocated or fixed size disk type.
   - Specify disk size (e.g., 50 GB or more is recommended).

6. **Mount the Windows ISO**:

   - Select the newly created VM and click "Start".
   - When prompted for a start-up disk, browse and select the Windows ISO file.

7. **Install Windows**:

   - The Windows installer will boot in the VM.
   - Follow the Windows installation process (select language, enter product key or skip, choose install type, etc.).
   - Complete the installation with user setup and initial configurations.

8. **Install Guest Additions (optional but recommended)**:
   - After Windows is installed, install VirtualBox Guest Additions for better integration, performance, and features like
     clipboard sharing and dynamic screen resizing.

This method supports Windows 10, Windows 11, and earlier versions with minor adjustments. For best performance, allocate
enough CPU cores and RAM based on your host resources.[1][3][5]
