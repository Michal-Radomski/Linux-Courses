The main difference between NAT (Network Address Translation) and bridged network modes in VirtualBox lies in how the virtual
machine (VM) connects to the external network and how visible and accessible it is from other machines.

- NAT mode places the VM behind a virtual router that translates its network traffic to the host's IP address. This makes the
  VM act like a device on a private network isolated from the outside. The VM can access external networks, including the
  internet, but other devices on the physical network, including the host, cannot directly see or access the VM unless port
  forwarding is configured. This mode provides good security and is simple to use since no network configuration is needed on
  the host network.[1][2]

- Bridged mode connects the VMâ€™s virtual network card directly to the host's physical network interface using a network
  filter driver. The VM appears as a separate physical device on the same network as the host with its own IP address in the
  network's range. This allows other devices on the same network, including the host and other physical machines, to
  communicate freely with the VM as if it were a separate computer on the network. This mode is preferred for scenarios where
  the VM must be fully accessible on the local network or act as a server.[2][1]

In summary:

| Feature                  | NAT                                     | Bridged                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| VM network visibility    | Hidden behind host IP (private network) | Visible on the physical network     |
| Access to VM from host   | No (without port forwarding)            | Yes                                 |
| Access to VM from others | No (without port forwarding)            | Yes                                 |
| Setup complexity         | Simple, no network config needed        | Requires host network compatibility |
| Use case                 | General internet access, isolated VM    | VM as a network peer/server on LAN  |

NAT offers isolation and ease of use; bridged is for full network presence and accessibility.[3][4][2]
