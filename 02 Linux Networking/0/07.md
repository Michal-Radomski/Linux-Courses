Here is a comparison of basic operations among YUM, DNF, and APT package managers focusing on equivalent commands for
installing, updating, removing packages, and other package management tasks:

| Operation               | YUM Command                   | DNF Command                   | APT Command                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Install package         | sudo yum install package-name | sudo dnf install package-name | sudo apt install package-name       |
| Update all packages     | sudo yum update               | sudo dnf update               | sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade |
| Remove package          | sudo yum remove package-name  | sudo dnf remove package-name  | sudo apt remove package-name        |
| Search for package      | yum search keyword            | dnf search keyword            | apt search keyword                  |
| List installed packages | yum list installed            | dnf list installed            | apt list --installed                |
| Show package info       | yum info package-name         | dnf info package-name         | apt show package-name               |
| Clean package cache     | sudo yum clean all            | sudo dnf clean all            | sudo apt clean                      |
| Check for updates       | yum check-update              | dnf check-update              | apt list --upgradable               |
| Install package group   | sudo yum groupinstall "Group" | sudo dnf groupinstall "Group" | (Not applicable)\*                  |
| Remove unused packages  | sudo yum autoremove           | sudo dnf autoremove           | sudo apt autoremove                 |

\* APT does not have a direct equivalent for "groupinstall" but can install meta-packages that serve group purposes.

### Notes

- DNF is the modern replacement for YUM with better performance and improved dependency resolution, and it supports most
  legacy YUM commands.
- APT commands typically combine repository update and package upgrade in two steps (`apt update` and `apt upgrade`).
- All three handle dependencies automatically.
- YUM and DNF work with RPM packages on Red Hat-based systems, whereas APT manages DEB packages on Debian-based systems.
- Syntax similarities between YUM and DNF make the transition simple; APT syntax differs but is user-friendly.

This comparison provides a practical overview of accomplishing common package management tasks using each tool.[1][2][3][7]

Here are the base operations using YUM and DNF, the two common package managers on Red Hat-based Linux systems like CentOS,
Fedora, and RHEL:

### YUM Basic Commands

- Install a package:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install package-name
  ```
- Update all packages:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  ```
- Remove a package:
  ```bash
  sudo yum remove package-name
  ```
- Search for packages matching a keyword:
  ```bash
  yum search keyword
  ```
- List installed packages:
  ```bash
  yum list installed
  ```
- Show detailed info about a package:
  ```bash
  yum info package-name
  ```
- Clean YUM cache to free space:
  ```bash
  sudo yum clean all
  ```
- Check for available updates without installing:
  ```bash
  yum check-update
  ```
- Install a group of related packages:
  ```bash
  sudo yum groupinstall "Group Name"
  ```
- Remove unused dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo yum autoremove
  ```

### DNF Basic Commands

DNF is the next-generation package manager replacing YUM in newer Fedora and RHEL/CentOS versions. Its usage is almost
identical, so the equivalent DNF commands are:

- Install a package:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install package-name
  ```
- Update all packages:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf update
  ```
- Remove a package:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf remove package-name
  ```
- Search for packages:
  ```bash
  dnf search keyword
  ```
- List installed packages:
  ```bash
  dnf list installed
  ```
- Show package info:
  ```bash
  dnf info package-name
  ```
- Clean cache:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf clean all
  ```
- Check for updates:
  ```bash
  dnf check-update
  ```
- Install package groups:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf groupinstall "Group Name"
  ```
- Remove unused dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf autoremove
  ```

The commands between YUM and DNF are very similar, making it easy to switch between them depending on the Linux distribution
version. Both handle package installation, updates, removals, searching, info, and cleanup tasks efficiently.Here are the
basic operations using YUM and DNF package managers, commonly used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions like CentOS, Fedora,
and RHEL:[1][2][3]
