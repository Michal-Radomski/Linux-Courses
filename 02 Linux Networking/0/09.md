The terms seat0, tty2, and pts/1 in the output of the Linux who command refer to different types of user terminals or
sessions:

- seat0: This indicates a physical seat or console connected directly to the machine, usually the local graphical session or
  physical keyboard and monitor. It is managed by the system's login manager.

- tty2: This is a traditional Linux virtual console or terminal session accessed by pressing keys like Ctrl+Alt+F2. tty
  stands for "teletype," representing a text-based terminal interface. Usually tty1 to tty6 are virtual consoles.

- pts/1: This stands for "pseudo terminal slave" device, representing terminal sessions spawned over network connections
  (such as SSH) or terminal emulator windows inside a graphical environment. These are virtual terminals managed by the
  operating system for remote or graphical terminal access.

Essentially:

- seat0 = physical graphical console session,
- tty2 = virtual console session at the system level,
- pts/1 = virtual terminal session for remote or graphical terminals.

These identifiers correspond to the terminal or session device associated with each logged-in user that who reports. They
represent where the user is logged in from or which terminal session they are using.[1][2][3]
