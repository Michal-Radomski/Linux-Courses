The VirtualBox Extension Pack is an add-on package for VirtualBox that provides advanced features not included in the base
installation. Its key functionalities include:

- USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 device support, allowing virtual machines to use faster and more varied USB peripherals such as
  external hard drives, network adapters, and webcams. Without the Extension Pack, USB support is limited to USB 1.1.
- Host webcam passthrough, enabling the guest system to use the host computer's webcam even if the guest OS lacks native
  support.
- VirtualBox Remote Desktop Protocol (VRDP), which allows remote access and control of virtual machines via RDP clients,
  useful for remote management.
- Disk image encryption using AES (128-bit or 256-bit) to secure virtual disk data.
- Intel PXE boot ROM for network booting of VMs via Preboot Execution Environment, helpful for automated OS installations.
- NVMe storage controller virtualization and PCI passthrough for improved disk I/O performance and hardware access.

The Extension Pack is free for personal, educational, and evaluation use but requires a paid commercial license for
enterprise or business use.[1][2][3]

Thus, the Extension Pack extends VirtualBox's capabilities significantly for advanced use cases and is essential if features
like USB 2.0/3.0 support or remote VM access are needed.
