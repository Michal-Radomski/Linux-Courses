SearchSploit is a command-line search tool in Kali Linux that lets you search the Exploit Database (Exploit-DB) offline. It
provides access to a local copy of thousands of public exploits, shellcodes, and security advisories. This tool is valuable
during penetration testing or security assessments, especially when internet access is unavailable or limited.

To use SearchSploit, simply open a terminal in Kali Linux and type `searchsploit` followed by your search terms. For example,
to find exploits related to "windows," you would type:

```
searchsploit windows
```

This will list exploits matching "windows" with titles, descriptions, and paths to the exploit files on your system.

Some useful command options include:

- `-u` to update the local exploit database.
- `-m [EDB-ID]` to copy a specific exploit (by its Exploit Database ID) to the current directory.
- `-p [EDB-ID]` to show the full path to an exploit.
- `-h` to display help and all options.

Example usage:

```
searchsploit -m 39446
```

copies the exploit with ID 39446 to your working directory.

SearchSploit allows filtering searches with options for case sensitivity, exact matches, JSON output, and more, providing
flexibility for finding relevant exploits quickly.

In summary, SearchSploit is a powerful and convenient offline tool bundled in Kali Linux for searching exploits from the
comprehensive Exploit Database, useful for ethical hackers and security testers to quickly find and utilize exploits during
assessments.[1][2][3][4]
