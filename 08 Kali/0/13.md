Here is a description of the three tools: WhatWeb, Whois, and Dirb, commonly used in Kali Linux for information gathering and
web application testing.

WhatWeb:

- WhatWeb is an open-source web scanner tool written in Ruby that identifies the technologies used by a website, including
  content management systems (CMS), JavaScript libraries, analytics packages, and server software.
- It operates with over 1800 plugins to recognize different technologies and can be run in different modes balancing speed,
  stealth, and reliability.
- WhatWeb detects version numbers, email addresses, server banners, and other metadata that helps in footprinting.
- It supports proxy usage, custom headers, web redirection control, and outputs data in multiple formats such as plain text,
  XML, JSON, or to databases.
- Usage example: `whatweb <target-website-url>`

Whois:

- Whois is a command-line tool that queries databases to find registration details about domain names or IP address
  allocations.
- It provides information on domain ownership, registrar, creation and expiration dates, name servers, contact emails, and
  registration status.
- Useful for gathering background information about a target domain's ownership and administrative details.

Dirb:

- Dirb is a web content scanner that performs brute force directory and file scanning on web servers.
- It systematically tries common file and directory names from wordlists to discover hidden or unlinked content like admin
  pages, scripts, or backup files.
- Dirb helps identify potential attack points by locating accessible resources not linked openly on the website.
- Usage example: `dirb http://target-website.com /path/to/wordlist.txt`

In summary, WhatWeb fingerprints web technologies, Whois retrieves domain registration info, and Dirb brute-forces
directories and files on web servers—each tool offering different but complementary reconnaissance capabilities in the Kali
Linux toolkit for security assessments.[1][4][9][10]
