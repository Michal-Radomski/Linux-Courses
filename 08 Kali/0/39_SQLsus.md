SQLsus is an open-source MySQL injection and takeover tool written in Perl, specifically designed for exploiting SQL
injection vulnerabilities in MySQL databases. It provides a command-line interface allowing security testers to retrieve the
structure of databases, inject custom SQL queries, download files from the web server, crawl for writable directories, upload
and control a backdoor, clone databases, and more. SQLsus emphasizes speed and efficiency by using a powerful blind SQL
injection attack algorithm and supports multi-threading to perform attacks concurrently.

It also supports HTTPS and works via both GET and POST methods, with features like cookie management, SOCKS proxy, and HTTP
authentication. When access to the information_schema database is restricted, SQLsus can perform brute-force attacks to guess
table names. Additionally, it allows cloning a database or parts of it locally in SQLite format to continue analysis across
sessions.

SQLsus is particularly useful for penetration testers targeting MySQL servers in web applications and is known for its
specialized capabilities in handling MySQL injection and database takeover scenarios.[1][2][3]
