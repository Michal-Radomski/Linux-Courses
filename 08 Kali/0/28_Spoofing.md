Spoofing in cybersecurity is a technique where an attacker impersonates a trusted entity or disguises their identity to
deceive others, aiming to gain unauthorized access, steal data, spread malware, or conduct other malicious activities. This
deception can take various forms such as email spoofing, IP spoofing, website spoofing, DNS spoofing, and more. Spoofing
often involves social engineering, where attackers manipulate victims into trusting them, for example by sending fake emails
that appear from legitimate sources to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or making fraudulent transactions.

In essence, spoofing is about faking the origin or identity of communication to mislead the target. It can be used to bypass
security controls, intercept communications (like in man-in-the-middle attacks), overload systems (as in denial-of-service
attacks), or harvest credentials. Preventing spoofing involves techniques such as validating source addresses, using strong
authentication methods, and educating users to recognize suspicious communications.

To summarize, spoofing is a broad category of attacks based on impersonation that relies heavily on technical trickery
combined with psychological manipulation to exploit trust.[1][2][4][5][6]
