Red Hawk is an open-source, all-in-one information gathering and vulnerability scanning tool designed mainly for web
application penetration testing. Written in PHP, it is used to scan websites to collect a wide range of information and
identify potential security vulnerabilities. Red Hawk can detect the target’s IP address, web server details, Content
Management System (CMS) such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Magento, as well as Cloudflare protection status. It also
gathers WHOIS data, performs Geo-IP lookups, banner grabbing, DNS checks, port scanning, and subdomain enumeration.
Additionally, Red Hawk looks for error-based SQL injection vulnerabilities, sensitive files on WordPress sites, and
version-related vulnerabilities on CMS platforms.

How to use Red Hawk:

1. First, clone the Red Hawk repository from GitHub using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Tuhinshubhra/RED_HAWK.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd RED_HAWK
   ```
3. Run the tool using PHP:
   ```
   php rhawk.php
   ```
4. When prompted, enter the website URL you want to scan (ensure you have authorization to scan the target).
5. Red Hawk will run through its scanning modules and display information such as IP address, CMS detection, vulnerability
   findings, and more.

Red Hawk is useful for penetration testers and security professionals looking for a comprehensive reconnaissance tool that
includes information gathering and vulnerability assessment features in a single package.[1][3][4][5]
