Kali Linux is an open-source Linux distribution specifically designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and digital
forensics. Developed and maintained by Offensive Security, it is widely used by cybersecurity professionals to identify
system vulnerabilities, assess network security, perform reverse engineering, and conduct forensic investigations. Originally
known as BackTrack Linux, Kali Linux is based on Debian and comes pre-installed with hundreds of security tools, including
network scanners like Nmap, penetration testing frameworks like Metasploit, and packet analyzers like Wireshark, among many
others.

Kali Linux supports a broad range of hardware, including ARM devices like Raspberry Pi, and offers a live boot feature
allowing users to run it from a USB drive without installation. It also supports persistence for saving settings and
customizations across sessions. The operating system is highly customizable and follows a rolling release cycle for
continuous updates. It features multi-language support, a custom kernel patched for injection, and is developed in a secure
environment with signed packages and repositories for security and reliability.

Kali Linux is favored for its extensive toolkit, flexibility, and strong community support, making it the go-to platform for
security professionals conducting penetration tests and security audits to protect systems and networks against cyber
threats.[1][2][3]
