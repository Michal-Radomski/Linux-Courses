You can get lists of passwords (wordlists) for dictionary attacks from various online sources dedicated to collecting and
providing such wordlists for password cracking tools like Aircrack-ng, John the Ripper, and Hashcat.

### Common Sources to Obtain Password Wordlists:

- **GitHub repositories:** For example, the mishrasunny174/WordLists repository contains a collection of diverse and large
  password lists, including specialized ones like Indian mobile numbers, and general wordlists of several gigabytes.
- **Aircrack-ng Default Wordlists:** Aircrack-ng itself includes a small default dictionary file usually named `password.lst`
  located in the “test” directory of the source files.
- **Popular Wordlist Collections:**
  - **RockYou:** One of the most famous wordlists compiled from leaked passwords.
  - **SecLists:** A security test wordlist collection that includes passwords, usernames, and more.
- **Custom Wordlists:** You can generate your own using tools like John the Ripper or Crunch, which allow for tailored
  password generation based on rules or patterns.

### Important Notes:

- Using high-quality and relevant wordlists improves success rates in cracking.
- Wordlists can be very large, requiring substantial disk space and memory to handle effectively.
- Always ensure ethical and authorized use of these wordlists for penetration testing or security research.

These wordlists can be downloaded from GitHub, security forums, or dedicated password cracking resource sites. For example,
the mishrasunny174/WordLists GitHub repository is a known resource to download various extensive wordlists.[1][2][3]
