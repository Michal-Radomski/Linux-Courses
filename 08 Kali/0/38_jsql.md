jsql is a Java-based open-source SQL injection tool used for penetration testing to retrieve database information from a
remote server by exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. It's cross-platform and simplifies interaction with databases
using SQL-like syntax, allowing penetration testers to extract, update, or delete database records, often via automated
processes. jsql supports commands such as SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE, and it can export data in various formats like textual
content or Excel files.

### How to Use jsql

1. **Setup**: jsql is run from a Java environment on any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).
2. **Targeting**: You input the target web application URL suspected of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
3. **Injection Process**: The tool attempts to identify injectable parameters and exploits those to obtain database
   information.
4. **Data Extraction**: jsql uses JSON objects for data retrieval and supports detailed querying using SQL-like features.
5. **Analysis & Export**: Collected data can be graphically sorted, filtered, viewed, and exported for further forensic
   analysis.

jsql is a user-friendly tool for automated SQL injection testing, used by security professionals to audit web applications by
exposing database-related vulnerabilities effectively.[1]

In summary, jsql is a Java tool for penetration testing that automates SQL injection exploitation to gather information from
vulnerable databases securely and efficiently.
