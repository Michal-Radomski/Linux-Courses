Pentbox is a security suite written in Ruby that provides a collection of tools aimed at simplifying and streamlining
penetration testing tasks. It is designed primarily for use on GNU/Linux systems and includes various utilities for cracking
hashes, network information gathering, stress testing, web reconnaissance, and more.

### What is Pentbox?

- Pentbox offers multiple categories of tools including cryptography tools (Base64 encoding/decoding, hash cracking, password
  generation), network tools (DoS testing, TCP port scanning, honeypot setup, DNS/host gathering, MAC address geolocation),
  and web tools (directory brute forcing and discovery of common files on web servers).
- It aims to be an all-in-one toolkit that is easy to use, especially for penetration testers with less experience.
- Pentbox is written in Ruby and is portable across multiple platforms.
- It supports activities such as hash cracking, stress testing networks, reconnaissance, and directory brute forcing, making
  it useful across various stages of penetration testing.

### How to Use Pentbox?

1. **Installation:** Install Pentbox on Linux systems by cloning its repository or installing via package managers if
   available.
2. **Launch:** Run Pentbox from the terminal to access its tool menu with categorized options.
3. **Select Tools:** Choose the tool category (Cryptography, Network, Web) based on your penetration testing goals.
4. **Configure and Run:** Follow prompts for input, such as specifying target IPs, hash values, or URL endpoints.
5. **Analyze Results:** Use the outputs for further penetration testing steps or vulnerability assessment.

Pentbox is considered user-friendly for those new to penetration testing while offering several powerful features that can
augment an experienced tester’s toolkit. It is recommended as an easy-to-use multi-tool suite for penetration testers seeking
a flexible environment with some automation and integrated tools.[1][3][5][8]
