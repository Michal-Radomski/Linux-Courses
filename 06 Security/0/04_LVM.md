LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a powerful Linux feature that provides an abstraction layer between physical storage devices
(such as hard disk partitions or drives) and the filesystems that use them. It allows flexible management of disk space by
pooling physical volumes into volume groups, from which logical volumes are created. Logical volumes act like virtual
partitions that can span multiple physical devices, be resized dynamically, and managed independently of physical hardware
constraints.

Key concepts in LVM include:

- Physical Volumes (PVs): Actual physical storage devices or partitions.
- Volume Groups (VGs): Pools of storage created by combining multiple physical volumes.
- Logical Volumes (LVs): Virtual partitions carved out from volume groups that can be formatted with filesystems.

LVM offers significant advantages like resizing volumes without downtime, adding or removing physical disks easily, and
creating snapshots for backups. This abstraction provides more flexibility and control over storage compared to traditional
partitioning, especially on systems where storage needs may frequently change or grow.[1][2][4][7]
