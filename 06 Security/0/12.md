The `lsattr` command in Linux is used to display the extended attributes of files and directories on filesystems that support
them (like ext2, ext3, ext4). It shows metadata about how the file is handled by the system beyond normal file permissions.

### Usage:

```bash
lsattr [options] <file/directory>
```

Without options, it lists the attributes for the specified files/directories.

### Common options:

- `-a`: List all files including hidden files.
- `-d`: List directory attributes instead of contents.
- `-l`: Show long format with attribute names.
- `-R`: Recursively list attributes of directories and their contents.

### Meaning of each attribute sign shown by `lsattr` (each position represents a specific attribute, a "-" means the attribute is not set):

| Attribute | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `a`       | Append-only: file can only be appended to, not modified/removed.   |
| `c`       | Compressed: file is compressed by the filesystem.                  |
| `d`       | No dump: file is excluded from backup utilities like dump.         |
| `e`       | Extents: file uses extents for data layout to improve performance. |
| `i`       | Immutable: file cannot be modified, deleted, or renamed.           |
| `j`       | Data journaling: file changes are journaled for crash safety.      |
| `s`       | Synchronous updates: writes are synchronous to disk.               |
| `S`       | Secure deletion: blocks are zeroed when deleted.                   |
| `t`       | Top of directory hierarchy (specific to some filesystems).         |
| `u`       | Undeletable: file can be undeleted (recovery info stored).         |

Other letters or attributes may appear depending on filesystem and kernel version, but these are the core ones.

A "-" at any attribute position means that attribute is not enabled for that file.

The `lsattr` command is mainly used with `chattr`, which sets or clears these attributes.

This command is valuable for system administrators to diagnose or protect files by checking these extended attributes.[1]
