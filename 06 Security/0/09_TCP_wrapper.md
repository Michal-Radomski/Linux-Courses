A TCP wrapper in Linux is a host-based networking access control system used to filter and restrict network access to
Internet Protocol services based on the source of the connection. It primarily controls access through configuration files
(/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny) that specify which hosts or networks can or cannot connect to network services. It
operates at the application layer and can be used to allow or deny access to services based on IP addresses, hostnames, or
ident queries. TCP wrappers provide runtime reconfiguration of access control without needing to restart services and offer
logging capabilities to monitor connection attempts, enhancing network security. It was originally designed for use with
services spawned by super-servers like inetd but can also be linked directly into modern service daemons. Its simplicity and
ease of configuration make it useful for basic network security in Linux systems alongside firewalls or more advanced
security tools.[1][2][3]
