The `visudo` command in Linux is a specialized editor used to safely edit the sudoers file, which controls user privileges
for the `sudo` command. Unlike directly editing `/etc/sudoers`, `visudo` locks the file to prevent multiple simultaneous
edits and performs syntax checking before saving changes. This prevents errors that could lock users out of administrative
access due to misconfiguration.

`visudo` opens the sudoers file (usually `/etc/sudoers`) or files under `/etc/sudoers.d/` for editing in your default text
editor, ensuring safe modification of sudo permissions. It also supports a syntax check mode (`visudo -c`) to validate the
sudoers configuration without making changes.

Using `visudo` is considered best practice because it protects system integrity and helps avoid configuration errors related
to sudo access management.

In summary, `visudo` is the recommended tool for editing sudoers files safely with syntax validation and file locking, to
manage sudo privileges securely on Linux systems.[1][2][3]
