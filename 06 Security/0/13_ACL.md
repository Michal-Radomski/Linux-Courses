An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a
particular resource in a computer system or network. ACLs list permissions that define who can access an object, such as a
file, directory, or network resource, and what operations they can perform, like reading, writing, or executing. Each
resource has an ACL with entries for every user or group allowed or denied access, providing fine-grained control beyond
traditional permission models.

ACLs are used to enforce security policies by filtering access to system resources, networks, or files, often specifying user
roles such as administrators or guests with varying degrees of access. In networks, ACLs can control traffic flow by allowing
or blocking packets based on IP addresses, protocols, or ports, improving security and managing network traffic efficiently.

In summary, ACLs are crucial for managing permissions in both operating systems and networks, enabling administrators to
precisely control access to resources and enhance security.[1][2][3]
