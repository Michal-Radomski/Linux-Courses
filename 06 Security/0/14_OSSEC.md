OSSEC is an open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) designed to monitor and protect individual hosts or
servers by analyzing system logs, file integrity, rootkits, and other security events in real time. It aggregates and
correlates data from various sources on the monitored systems to detect suspicious activity, policy violations, or signs of
compromise.

Key features of OSSEC include:

- Log-based intrusion detection by monitoring and analyzing logs from multiple sources.
- File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), which tracks changes to important files and registry settings.
- Rootkit and malware detection through process and file-level analysis.
- Real-time alerting and active response capabilities that can trigger automated reactions like blocking an attack.
- Compliance auditing to help meet standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA.
- Cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, macOS, Solaris, and more.
- Centralized management for scalability over many machines.
- Agent-based and agentless monitoring, enabling flexible deployment across different environments.

OSSEC is widely used by organizations of all sizes for improving security posture through continuous monitoring and fast
detection of threats on endpoints and servers.[1][2][3][4][5]

In summary, OSSEC is a powerful, versatile HIDS tool that enhances security by providing detailed system-level monitoring,
alerting, and regulatory compliance support.
