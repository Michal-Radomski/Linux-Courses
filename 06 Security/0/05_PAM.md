To add PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) to a Linux system, you typically install PAM packages using your Linux
distribution's package manager. For example:

- On Ubuntu or Debian:  
  `sudo apt install libpam-modules`
- On CentOS or RHEL:  
  `sudo yum install pam`
- On Arch Linux:  
  `sudo pacman -S pambase`

After installation, PAM configuration files are located mainly in `/etc/pam.d/` for service-specific configurations like
sshd, login, sudo, etc. The older method uses `/etc/pam.conf`, but modern systems mostly use `/etc/pam.d/`.

Each configuration file contains lines specifying the type, control flag, module, and arguments (e.g.,
`auth required pam_unix.so`), defining how authentication is handled for that service. You can customize or add modules as
needed by editing these files to control authentication behavior.

Caution is advised when editing PAM configurations, as incorrect settings can lock you out of the system. It is recommended
to backup configuration files before making changes.

This approach allows centralized, modular authentication management on Linux systems via PAM.[1][2][6]
