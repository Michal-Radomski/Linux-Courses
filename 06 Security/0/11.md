Special permissions in Linux are special mode bits that extend standard file system permissions, allowing for particular
behaviors and security controls on files and directories. The three main special permissions are:

1. Set User ID (SUID):

   - When set on an executable file, it allows the file to be run with the privileges of the file’s owner rather than the
     user running it.
   - This is useful for programs requiring elevated privileges temporarily, such as `passwd` which needs root permissions to
     change passwords.
   - In the permissions display, SUID is shown as an "s" in the owner's execute bit position (e.g., `-rwsr-xr-x`).

2. Set Group ID (SGID):

   - When set on an executable, the program runs with the privileges of the file’s group.
   - When set on a directory, new files created inside inherit the directory’s group ownership rather than the creator’s
     default group. This is helpful in collaborative directories.
   - Displayed as an "s" in the group execute bit position (e.g., `rwxr-sr-x`).

3. Sticky Bit:
   - Applied mostly to directories, it restricts file deletion or renaming within that directory so only the file owner,
     directory owner, or root can delete or rename files.
   - This prevents users from deleting or renaming other users' files in shared directories like `/tmp`.
   - Shown as a "t" in the others execute bit position (e.g., `rwxrwxrwt`).

These permissions enhance security and control by managing execution privileges and file management behaviors beyond basic
read/write/execute permissions. They are configured using `chmod` with specific symbolic or octal flags and are critical for
system administration and multi-user environments.[1][2][3][4][5][6][8][10]
