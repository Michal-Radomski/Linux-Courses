To secure SSHD (the SSH daemon) on Linux, applying best practices in the SSH configuration and system settings is crucial to
reduce vulnerabilities and protect remote access:

- Disable root login by setting `PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to prevent attackers from directly accessing
  the most privileged account.
- Use key-based authentication and disable password authentication with `PasswordAuthentication no` to prevent brute-force
  password attacks.
- Change the default SSH port from 22 to a non-standard port using the `Port` directive to reduce automated attack noise.
- Limit user logins to only necessary accounts using the `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` directives.
- Set a limit on maximum authentication attempts with `MaxAuthTries` (recommended 3 or 4) to mitigate brute-force risks.
- Configure idle session timeouts using `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax` to disconnect inactive sessions
  automatically.
- Disable usersâ€™ ability to set environment variables via SSH by setting `PermitUserEnvironment no`.
- Use tools like Fail2Ban to block IP addresses exhibiting malicious login attempts.
- Keep SSH server software updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use firewall rules to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses or networks wherever possible.
- Optionally, use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on top of SSH keys for an additional layer of security.

After making changes in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, restart SSHD to apply settings (`sudo systemctl restart sshd`). Regularly
review logs and monitor for suspicious activity.

These combined measures constitute a strong security posture for SSHD on Linux systems, significantly reducing the attack
surface and enhancing control over remote access.[1][2][3]
