Single user mode in Linux is a special operating mode where the system boots with only one user active—the superuser (root).
It is mainly used for system maintenance, troubleshooting, and emergency repairs when network services and multi-user
environments are not needed or cannot function properly. In this mode, the system typically mounts local filesystems and
offers a maintenance command-line shell with minimal services running, allowing the user to perform tasks like filesystem
checks, password resets, and fixing boot or configuration problems. Single user mode is also useful when the system cannot
boot normally or when exclusive access to shared resources is necessary. It usually corresponds to runlevel 1 or
runlevel1.target in systemd systems.

The mode can be entered by modifying boot parameters during startup, such as editing the GRUB boot loader, or by issuing the
"init 1" command on a running system to switch to single user mode. On some systems like macOS, different commands exist but
the principle is similar—booting into a minimal, maintenance environment with root access. This mode restricts network
services, enhancing security by reducing outside interference.

Overall, single user mode is a crucial recovery and maintenance tool in Linux and Unix-like systems that provides full
control to a single user for managing critical tasks safely.[1][2][3]
